### 个人情况
1. 分差描述 
- 目前，我的各部分分数差距为1.5分。 
- 日常与教授和母语为英语的朋友进行 small talk 没有问题，尤其是涉及科技、媒体和文化等领域的词汇与观点积累较丰富。 

2. 薄弱点 
- 面对运动、自然景观等基础话题，需要持续说十分钟时，词穷较严重（因死宅）。 
- 如果遇到不熟悉的话题，语言能力最先下降，其次是逻辑，流利度也会随之下降。

---

### 关键策略
#### 1. 交流感 
- 将考官视作第一次见面的朋友，保持自然的眼神交流。 

#### 2. 流利度优先 
- 语言表达要顺畅，尤其是语速和连贯性，哪怕内容略简单，也要确保流利。

#### 3. 逻辑性强化 
- 像写作一样注重清晰的论证与衔接，形成逻辑闭环。 

---

### 各部分技巧
#### PART 1：流利性优先
- 回答结构：直接回答问题 + 简单原因/补充信息。 
例子： 
Q: Do you think being on time is important? 
- Yes, absolutely! Being punctual ensures that activities, such as classes or meetings, can proceed smoothly. Plus, it reflects responsibility and helps leave a positive impression on peers and superiors.

#### PART 2：保证 6.5 表现的训练重点
1. 思路框架化 
- 结构：总分总/时间顺序/事物不同方面。 
- 尽量使用从句衔接，提高表达层次。 
例子： 
Q: Describe a natural place you’d like to visit. 
- I’d love to visit the Amazon Rainforest. It’s not just the largest rainforest in the world but also home to countless species of plants and animals. I’ve read about its incredible biodiversity and would love to experience its serene beauty. Moreover, understanding the ecosystem there could help me appreciate how interconnected our environment truly is.

2. 同类话题迁移 
- 学会总结回答的核心逻辑并灵活套用。 
例子： 
Q: How does consumption impact the environment? 
- Consumption significantly affects our environment, especially waste management. For example, packaging waste often ends up in landfills, polluting water and soil. This pattern can lead to long-term issues like biodiversity loss and climate change. 
（这类逻辑同样适用于问题“如何减少环境污染？”）

#### PART 3：逻辑为核心
- 回答时先搭建框架，分层论证，每层具体展开1-2句。 
例子：
Q: How do advertisements influence society? 
- dvertisements shape society in two key ways. First, they impact consumer behavior. For instance, campaigns often create a demand for specific products by associating them with an aspirational lifestyle. Second, they influence cultural values. Public service advertisements, for example, promote awareness of social issues like environmental protection, thereby encouraging collective action.

---

### 扩展表达技巧
1. 用事物的不同方面展开 
- 物理层面（size, material, location）； 
- 功能层面（use, benefit, limitation）； 
- 社会/文化层面（symbolism, tradition, change）。

2. 用场景切换解释 
- 举例准时的不同场景：职业、学校、私人。 

3. 抽象到具体，再具体到抽象 
- 从观点出发，给出具体例子，然后总结出普遍意义。

具体题型

 题型一：Describe a Special Day That Costs You Little Money 
 
 One of the most memorable and special days in my life was my graduation day, which didn't cost me much but left a lasting impression on me. The day started with a simple ceremony at the university. It was a moment of celebration, but also one of reflection. I walked across the stage to receive my diploma, and the cheers from my friends and family made it even more special. Although the event itself wasn’t extravagant or overly expensive, the pride I felt in completing my degree was priceless. After the ceremony, my professor invited a small group of us to a modest yet heartwarming meal at a local restaurant. The meal wasn’t fancy at all—it was more about spending time with people who had supported us throughout our academic journey. It was a chance to express our gratitude and talk about our future aspirations. The warmth of the occasion and the camaraderie shared with my classmates and professors made the meal incredibly meaningful. What made the day even more special were the heartfelt messages I received from younger students, including some of my juniors who had looked up to me. They took the time to send me well wishes, and their kind words made me feel appreciated and connected to the university community in a deeper way. It was a reminder of how much I had grown during my time there and how my presence had made a difference to others. Overall, while the day didn’t require spending a lot of money, it was full of emotional value. The joy I felt came from the experiences and relationships built during my university years, and I will always cherish the memories of that day. 
 
 题型二：Describe a Long Walk That You Ever Had One of the longest and most 
 
 unforgettable walks I’ve ever had took place in July during my trip to New Zealand. It was a glacier hike on the Franz Josef Glacier, which is one of the most famous glaciers in the country. July was in the middle of New Zealand’s winter, so the conditions were particularly challenging, but the experience was absolutely worth it. I went on this hike with my senior from university, and we both eagerly looked forward to the adventure. We were dressed in multiple layers, but the cold was still intense, and the chill of the glacier was something I had never experienced before. As we began the hike, the icy winds were so biting that I could feel my face going numb, and the cold seeped through even the thickest layers of clothing. The path we walked on was a mixture of ice, snow, and rocks, which made it tricky to maintain balance. We had to wear crampons to avoid slipping, and our guide instructed us carefully on how to navigate the glacier safely. The walk was long—lasting about six hours—but it was physically demanding, especially due to the altitude and cold weather. Breathing felt heavier at times, and the thin, cold air made it a little harder to catch my breath. Despite the challenging conditions, the scenery was absolutely mesmerizing. The glacier itself was vast, and we walked through narrow ice tunnels, crossed small crevasses, and marveled at the stunning blue ice formations. We took a few breaks, huddling together to warm up for a moment, and the whole experience felt both exhilarating and peaceful at the same time. We could hear the soft creaking and cracking sounds of the ice, which added to the otherworldly atmosphere. My senior and I talked along the way, exchanging stories about our experiences and encouraging each other to keep going. The hike was tough, but sharing the journey with someone made it feel more manageable. The cold and exhaustion were difficult to push through, but when we finally reached a viewpoint with a panoramic view of the glacier and surrounding mountains, it felt like we had conquered a small world of our own. The entire hike was physically demanding, but it was also a chance to test my limits and enjoy the beauty of the natural world. It was an unforgettable adventure, and even though we were both exhausted by the end, we both agreed that the experience was one of the highlights of our trip to New Zealand. 
 
 题型三：Describe a time you received money from a family member.
 You should say:  1.when you received it 2.why you received it 3.what you did with the money and explain how you felt after receiving it 
 
 I don’t come from a very wealthy family, so I’ve never been given a huge amount of money in my life. The only time I can remember being given a significant amount of money was for my first Holy Communion. I’m Irish, I’m from a Catholic background, and if you grew up Catholic, when you’re around seven, eight years old, you do your first Holy Communion. It’s like a big milestone in a child’s life. Normally, family member will give you some money. I think at the time I was given between 40 and 50 pounds. So in the late 80s, early 90s, I can’t remember exactly when that was, early 90s, that was a significant amount of money. But I actually reminded my mother the other day that she took that money from me. I said she stole it from me. And her response was, well, we didn’t have any money, so I stole it from you to buy you food and to buy your clothes. So I di feel quite aggrieved at the time because a lot of my richer friends were going and buying toys and things like that. It was the first time I’d ever had a significant amount of money, and then it was taken from me right away. But looking back now, it fills me with gratitude. I’m very grateful that it happened because it shows how much my mother struggled and how hard she worked for me in order to set me up in life. Recently, my little boy did his first Holy Communication, and he got a lot more than I got. He wasted it on buying things in a computer game. It was a good opportunity for us to teach him about not wasting money. Now he wants to buy more things in the computer game, but I told him that he has to work for it and he has to do some jobs around the house if he wants that. （二）Describe a time you received money from a family member: You should say: 1.when you received it 2.why you received it 3.what you did with the money and explain how you felt after receiving it. 【My answer】It reminds me of the Chinese New Year festival, which we also call Chunjie in Chinese. During this time, it’s a traditional practice for elders, like uncles, aunts, grandparents, and parents, to give red pockets (red envelopes with money) to the younger generation. The idea is for children to use the money to buy things they like, such as toys or sweets. When I was younger, I received many red pockets from my relatives. However, my mom would always tell me, "You're too young to manage your money, so I'll save it for you. I'll give it back when you're older." Now that I've grown up, I often joke with her, wondering where all that money went. Did she spend it on herself? Who knows? Even so, I always felt incredibly happy receiving those red pockets. As a child, I didn’t have much pocket money for daily expenses, so receiving so much at once during the Spring Festival felt exciting and surprising. I’d often pretend to be astonished, but deep down, I was thrilled to have so much money at once.

题型四：Talk about a situation where you had to wait. 
You should say:
what you waited for why you had to wait 
what you did while waiting 
and explain how felt after waiting. 

Given the circumstances, I have to wait. I thought this was just for applying to a PhD program. Previously, I just had to wait for the application to be successful, and I didn't need to go through a gap year. I have a lot on my plate right now, so I have to wait until everything is sorted out. I also need to prepare for my English language test. There are usually four things I need to prepare: the English language test, the statement of purpose, and the letter of recommendation. And yes, they are all things that need to be taken care of. They're all things I have to prepare, so I have to wait a lot to find out the outcome. It's a process for me. While I was waiting, I kept on preparing my materials, like the exam procedures I had read about. For example, every Monday morning, I sent emails to a professor to ask if there were any PhD student positions available. It's a waiting game, but I have to say, I'm happy to wait. Yes, absolutely. 


题型五：sports

When I saw the topic of a sport I’ve watched but never tried myself, the first one that came to mind was figure skating. The first time I encountered it was during the 2014 Winter Olympic Games. My family and I were having dinner, and we turned on the TV, curious about what was on. That’s when we saw figure skating in progress, and I was immediately captivated. I thought, Wow, how beautiful and graceful! The way the skaters moved was mesmerizing—they looked like dancers, but even cooler with their incredible spins and jumps. It made me want to try it someday. However, there were a few reasons why I couldn’t pursue it. Firstly, I grew up in southeastern China, where the climate isn’t suitable for winter sports like skating. Secondly, figure skating is an expensive sport that requires significant financial investment, and my family couldn’t afford it. Although I couldn’t try it, I still dream of learning figure skating someday. If I have the time, energy, and financial resources in the future, I would love to give it a shot because it’s something I’ve always admired. 

题型六：The person you want to work with

I'd like to work with my supervisor, Chris, who I've been seeing recently. He's a very nice guy. He's kind and thoughtful. But the most important thing is that he works really hard. He gets things done in a very effective and efficient way. I first met him, and it was a bit of an unusual situation. I first learned of him not in the classroom or from reading their paper, but through social media. Yes, my tutor is quite influential on Weibo, which is a social media platform popular in my country. So what he did was set up the #MeToo movement, which helped a lot of people, including me, to find the support they needed. A girl got into it with some teachers and professors on social media because she was resisting the patriotic stuff. I think it's very characteristic of him. It's not easy for a man to understand what a woman or girl is going through. At the time, I was really impressed by my tutor. He's a very respectable and pleasant person. I know he came to our school to work. I was lucky enough to be his student. But it's a tough competition. I come out on top. So I became his student. And so what I wanted, why I wanted to work with him, was another important factor. As a tutor, he has a lot on his plate, a lot of things he should be doing, a lot of responsibilities. But everything he did was impressive. He's a great example for me. He gets up early to do research and just eats one meal a day, and then he does sports to stay healthy. I think that's really important. I loved working with him.

题型七：The chanllenging Time

Perhaps this is a particularly stressful and challenging time for me because I'm struggling to manage all my tasks effectively. I have to prepare for my language test, write my statement of purpose and revise my CV, all of which take a lot of time and energy. However, I find it difficult to do everything at once, especially with the limited time I have. At first I thought I could manage it well. I thought it would be relatively easy to get an 8.0 on the test. But after taking the exam seven times, I've realised how difficult it really is. What frustrates me the most is that I still haven't passed the test, even though English used to be my strongest subject. Back in high school, I loved English and it was often the subject that boosted my overall grades. Now, however, this English test may even force me to take a gap year because I can't seem to pass it. I feel sad and very worried about my future. After doing an internship during my undergraduate studies, I found out that I don't like certain jobs, like working in journalism, which is closely related to my major. I also know that I don't want to take a job in marketing. My goal is to apply for a PhD program. Although it’s not easy for me, t I've told myself many times that it doesn't matter. Just take it easy and time will tell.

题型八：Do you like to give others suggestion？ 

Honestly, I don’t particularly like giving others suggestions. The main reason is that everyone has their own unique experiences and backgrounds. Each person’s journey is different, and what works for one person might not necessarily work for someone else. I feel it’s difficult to give advice that truly suits someone else’s situation. For example, I used to be someone who loved asking others for advice. I remember once, I asked a senior whether I should pursue further studies. Their suggestion was based on their personal experience, and while it sounded reasonable, it didn’t entirely apply to my circumstances. Following their advice left me feeling uncertain, and I realized that their path wasn’t necessarily the right one for me. This experience taught me that while advice can be helpful, it’s important to understand your own goals and situation. That’s why I now prefer to share my experiences rather than offering direct suggestions. It’s up to others to decide what resonates with them. 

Emails and other communication tools offer convenience and efficiency. 
They allow instant messaging, file sharing, and real-time collaboration regardless of location. Emails provide a formal platform for professional communication, while tools like messaging apps enable quick and casual interactions, fostering better connectivity in both personal and professional contexts. 

题型九：Describe a natural viewpoint in China 
One of the most scenic natural viewpoints in China is Wutong Mountain in Shenzhen, located in the eastern part of the city. As the highest peak in Shenzhen, it offers a panoramic view of the surrounding cityscape, the lush greenery of the mountain, and the distant coastline.

The summit of Wutong Mountain stands at 943 meters above sea level, providing an expansive view of Shenzhen’s urban landscape on one side and the tranquil, natural beauty of the surrounding forests on the other. From the top, you can see the sprawling city beneath, framed by towering mountains and the shimmering waters of the South China Sea in the distance. The hike to the peak is a popular activity, attracting nature enthusiasts and hikers who are eager to enjoy both the physical challenge and the beautiful surroundings. Along the trail, visitors encounter dense forests, peaceful streams, and a variety of wildlife, which makes the journey feel like an escape from the urban hustle.

What makes Wutong Mountain especially memorable is its peaceful atmosphere and the striking contrast between nature and the fast-paced city life below. The mountain offers a tranquil retreat where one can experience Shenzhen's natural beauty in a setting that's only a short distance from the city center.

I chose this viewpoint because it highlights the harmony between nature and urban life, offering a rare opportunity to enjoy both in a single location. The view from Wutong Mountain is not only breathtaking but also provides a sense of connection to the surrounding environment.

题型十：Where do you like to study? 

I prefer studying in quiet and focused environments, and my favorite place to study is a lab space at my university. Unlike a library, where it can sometimes feel a bit crowded or formal, the lab has this relaxed yet productive vibe that really works for me. It’s a space where I can spread out my materials, plug in my laptop, and dive into my work without distractions. What I enjoy most is the clarity it gives me. The lab is well-lit and organized, which helps me keep my thoughts in order. Plus, it’s free from noise or interruptions—I find that essential for deep concentration, especially when I’m working on complex research or writing assignments. I also like how it feels separate from my personal space. Studying at home can blur the lines between work and relaxation, but when I’m in the lab, I know I’m there to focus. Once I leave, I feel accomplished and ready to unwind, which creates a nice balance. It might not sound very exciting, but for me, a clear, quiet, and comfortable environment like this is exactly what I need to get the most out of my study time. 

题型十一：Do you like study at cafe or library?

 I’d say it depends on the situation, but between the two, I’d lean towards the library. Libraries are quiet and focused, which is perfect for me when I need to dive deep into research or write something that requires a lot of concentration. The silence helps me stay in the zone, and I love being surrounded by shelves of books—it’s kind of inspiring! That said, I do see the appeal of studying in a café. Sometimes, the soft background noise and the smell of coffee can make the environment feel cozy and relaxed. If I’m working on something light, like brainstorming ideas or organizing my schedule, a café can be a refreshing change of pace. But if I had to pick, I’d choose the library. It’s like my go-to space when I really need to get things done. Cafés are nice for a bit of variety, but the library is where I’m most productive. As for how often I study in each place, I’d say I’m in the library most of the time. It’s the go-to spot, especially when I’m facing deadlines or need to concentrate deeply on a project. I probably spend around 80% of my study time there. The other 20% might be at a café, usually when I just need a change of scenery or when I’m doing more casual work, like reading articles or making plans. So, for me, it’s mostly about finding the right environment based on what I need to get done that day. When I need deep focus, the library wins; when I just want a bit of inspiration or a different vibe, I’ll head to a café. 

题型十二：Shenzhen’s City Facilities 

Shenzhen is an incredibly well-developed city that blends modern infrastructure with a forward-thinking approach to urban living. One of the standout features is its transportation system. The Shenzhen Metro is a real marvel—it’s fast, clean, and connects almost every part of the city. I think it’s one of the most efficient subway systems in the world. It makes getting around so easy, whether you're commuting during rush hour or exploring the city at your own pace. Apart from that, the public buses and shared bikes are also excellent. The buses are frequent, and the bike-sharing system, especially in areas like Futian and Nanshan, offers a convenient way to explore the city while getting some fresh air.

As for facilities, Shenzhen is known for its towering modern skyscrapers and cutting-edge technological parks, but it also incorporates green spaces, making it unique. Places like Shenzhen Central Park and Lianhua Mountain provide peaceful escapes from the urban hustle. Shenzhen is also famous for its business district, such as the Futian CBD, and the impressive Ping An Finance Centre, which symbolizes the city's rapid economic development.

In terms of shopping, Shenzhen offers something for everyone. From the luxury shopping malls in the Huaqiangbei area to the vibrant street markets in Dongmen, the city caters to all tastes and budgets. The city’s infrastructure also includes top-tier medical facilities, excellent schools, and a wide range of cultural institutions like museums, theaters, and galleries, making it a well-rounded place to live and work.

Overall, Shenzhen is a city that knows how to balance modern living with green spaces, offering world-class facilities without sacrificing the quality of life.
