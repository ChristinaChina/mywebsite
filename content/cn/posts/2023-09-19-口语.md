---

### 各部分技巧
#### PART 1：流利性优先
- 回答结构：直接回答问题 + 简单原因/补充信息。 
例子： 
Q: Do you think being on time is important? 
- Yes, absolutely! Being punctual ensures that activities, such as classes or meetings, can proceed smoothly. Plus, it reflects responsibility and helps leave a positive impression on peers and superiors.

#### PART 2：保证 6.5 表现的训练重点
1. 思路框架化 
- 结构：总分总/时间顺序/事物不同方面。 
- 尽量使用从句衔接，提高表达层次。 
例子： 
Q: Describe a natural place you’d like to visit. 
- I’d love to visit the Amazon Rainforest. It’s not just the largest rainforest in the world but also home to countless species of plants and animals. I’ve read about its incredible biodiversity and would love to experience its serene beauty. Moreover, understanding the ecosystem there could help me appreciate how interconnected our environment truly is.

2. 同类话题迁移 
- 学会总结回答的核心逻辑并灵活套用。 
例子： 
Q: How does consumption impact the environment? 
- Consumption significantly affects our environment, especially waste management. For example, packaging waste often ends up in landfills, polluting water and soil. This pattern can lead to long-term issues like biodiversity loss and climate change. 
（这类逻辑同样适用于问题“如何减少环境污染？”）

#### PART 3：逻辑为核心
- 回答时先搭建框架，分层论证，每层具体展开1-2句。 
例子：
Q: How do advertisements influence society? 
- dvertisements shape society in two key ways. First, they impact consumer behavior. For instance, campaigns often create a demand for specific products by associating them with an aspirational lifestyle. Second, they influence cultural values. Public service advertisements, for example, promote awareness of social issues like environmental protection, thereby encouraging collective action.

具体题型

 题一：Describe a Special Day That Costs You Little Money 
 
 One of the most memorable and special days in my life was my graduation day, which didn't cost me much but left a lasting impression on me. The day started with a simple ceremony at the university. It was a moment of celebration, but also one of reflection. I walked across the stage to receive my diploma, and the cheers from my friends and family made it even more special. Although the event itself wasn’t extravagant or overly expensive, the pride I felt in completing my degree was priceless. After the ceremony, my professor invited a small group of us to a modest yet heartwarming meal at a local restaurant. The meal wasn’t fancy at all—it was more about spending time with people who had supported us throughout our academic journey. It was a chance to express our gratitude and talk about our future aspirations. The warmth of the occasion and the camaraderie shared with my classmates and professors made the meal incredibly meaningful. What made the day even more special were the heartfelt messages I received from younger students, including some of my juniors who had looked up to me. They took the time to send me well wishes, and their kind words made me feel appreciated and connected to the university community in a deeper way. It was a reminder of how much I had grown during my time there and how my presence had made a difference to others. Overall, while the day didn’t require spending a lot of money, it was full of emotional value. The joy I felt came from the experiences and relationships built during my university years, and I will always cherish the memories of that day. 
 
 题二：Describe a Long Walk That You Ever Had One of the longest and most 
 
 unforgettable walks I’ve ever had took place in July during my trip to New Zealand. It was a glacier hike on the Franz Josef Glacier, which is one of the most famous glaciers in the country. July was in the middle of New Zealand’s winter, so the conditions were particularly challenging, but the experience was absolutely worth it. I went on this hike with my senior from university, and we both eagerly looked forward to the adventure. We were dressed in multiple layers, but the cold was still intense, and the chill of the glacier was something I had never experienced before. As we began the hike, the icy winds were so biting that I could feel my face going numb, and the cold seeped through even the thickest layers of clothing. The path we walked on was a mixture of ice, snow, and rocks, which made it tricky to maintain balance. We had to wear crampons to avoid slipping, and our guide instructed us carefully on how to navigate the glacier safely. The walk was long—lasting about six hours—but it was physically demanding, especially due to the altitude and cold weather. Breathing felt heavier at times, and the thin, cold air made it a little harder to catch my breath. Despite the challenging conditions, the scenery was absolutely mesmerizing. The glacier itself was vast, and we walked through narrow ice tunnels, crossed small crevasses, and marveled at the stunning blue ice formations. We took a few breaks, huddling together to warm up for a moment, and the whole experience felt both exhilarating and peaceful at the same time. We could hear the soft creaking and cracking sounds of the ice, which added to the otherworldly atmosphere. My senior and I talked along the way, exchanging stories about our experiences and encouraging each other to keep going. The hike was tough, but sharing the journey with someone made it feel more manageable. The cold and exhaustion were difficult to push through, but when we finally reached a viewpoint with a panoramic view of the glacier and surrounding mountains, it felt like we had conquered a small world of our own. The entire hike was physically demanding, but it was also a chance to test my limits and enjoy the beauty of the natural world. It was an unforgettable adventure, and even though we were both exhausted by the end, we both agreed that the experience was one of the highlights of our trip to New Zealand. 
 
 题三：Describe a time you received money from a family member.
 You should say:  
 1.when you received it 
 2.why you received it 
 3.what you did with the money and explain how you felt after receiving it 
 
 I don’t come from a very wealthy family, so I’ve never been given a huge amount of money in my life. The only time I can remember being given a significant amount of money was for my first Holy Communion. I’m Irish, I’m from a Catholic background, and if you grew up Catholic, when you’re around seven, eight years old, you do your first Holy Communion. It’s like a big milestone in a child’s life. Normally, family member will give you some money. I think at the time I was given between 40 and 50 pounds. So in the late 80s, early 90s, I can’t remember exactly when that was, early 90s, that was a significant amount of money. But I actually reminded my mother the other day that she took that money from me. I said she stole it from me. And her response was, well, we didn’t have any money, so I stole it from you to buy you food and to buy your clothes. So I di feel quite aggrieved at the time because a lot of my richer friends were going and buying toys and things like that. It was the first time I’d ever had a significant amount of money, and then it was taken from me right away. But looking back now, it fills me with gratitude. I’m very grateful that it happened because it shows how much my mother struggled and how hard she worked for me in order to set me up in life. Recently, my little boy did his first Holy Communication, and he got a lot more than I got. He wasted it on buying things in a computer game. It was a good opportunity for us to teach him about not wasting money. Now he wants to buy more things in the computer game, but I told him that he has to work for it and he has to do some jobs around the house if he wants that. 

 题四：Describe a time you received money from a family member.
 You should say: 
 1.when you received it 
 2.why you received it 
 3.what you did with the money and explain how you felt after receiving it. 
 
 It reminds me of the Chinese New Year festival, which we also call Chunjie in Chinese, its importance like your Christmas. During this time, it’s a traditional practice for elders, like uncles, aunts, grandparents, and parents, to give red pockets (red envelopes with money) to the younger generation. The idea is for children to use the money to buy things they like, such as toys or sweets. When I was younger, I received many red pockets from my relatives. However, my mom would always tell me, "You're too young to manage your money, so I'll save it for you. I'll give it back when you're older." Now that I've grown up, I often joke with her, wondering where all that money went. Did she spend it on herself? Who knows? Even so, I always felt incredibly happy receiving those red pockets. As a child, I didn’t have much pocket money for daily expenses, so receiving so much at once during the Spring Festival felt exciting and surprising. I’d often pretend to be astonished, but deep down, I was thrilled to have so much money at once.
 
 题五：Talk about a situation where you had to wait. 
 You should say:
 what you waited for why you had to wait 
 what you did while waiting 
 and explain how felt after waiting. 

Given the circumstances, I have to wait. I thought this was just for applying to a PhD program. Previously, I just had to wait for the application to be successful, and I didn't need to go through a gap year. I have a lot on my plate right now, so I have to wait until everything is sorted out. I also need to prepare for my English language test. There are usually four things I need to prepare: the English language test, the statement of purpose, and the letter of recommendation. And yes, they are all things that need to be taken care of. They're all things I have to prepare, so I have to wait a lot to find out the outcome. It's a process for me. While I was waiting, I kept on preparing my materials, like the exam procedures I had read about. For example, every Monday morning, I sent emails to a professor to ask if there were any PhD student positions available. It's a waiting game, but I have to say, I'm happy to wait. Yes, absolutely. 


题六：sports
When I saw the topic of a sport I’ve watched but never tried myself, the first one that came to mind was figure skating. The first time I encountered it was during the 2014 Winter Olympic Games. My family and I were having dinner, and we turned on the TV, curious about what was on. That’s when we saw figure skating in progress, and I was immediately captivated. I thought, Wow, how beautiful and graceful! The way the skaters moved was mesmerizing—they looked like dancers, but even cooler with their incredible spins and jumps. It made me want to try it someday. However, there were a few reasons why I couldn’t pursue it. Firstly, I grew up in southeastern China, where the climate isn’t suitable for winter sports like skating. Secondly, figure skating is an expensive sport that requires significant financial investment, and my family couldn’t afford it. Although I couldn’t try it, I still dream of learning figure skating someday. If I have the time, energy, and financial resources in the future, I would love to give it a shot because it’s something I’ve always admired. 

题七：The person you want to work with

I'd like to work with my supervisor, Chris, who I've been seeing recently. He's a very nice guy. He's kind and thoughtful. But the most important thing is that he works really hard. He gets things done in a very effective and efficient way. I first met him, and it was a bit of an unusual situation. I first learned of him not in the classroom or from reading their paper, but through social media. Yes, my tutor is quite influential on Weibo, which is a social media platform popular in my country. So what he did was set up the #MeToo movement, which helped a lot of people, including me, to find the support they needed. A girl got into it with some teachers and professors on social media because she was resisting the patriotic stuff. I think it's very characteristic of him. It's not easy for a man to understand what a woman or girl is going through. At the time, I was really impressed by my tutor. He's a very respectable and pleasant person. I know he came to our school to work. I was lucky enough to be his student. But it's a tough competition. I come out on top. So I became his student. And so what I wanted, why I wanted to work with him, was another important factor. As a tutor, he has a lot on his plate, a lot of things he should be doing, a lot of responsibilities. But everything he did was impressive. He's a great example for me. He gets up early to do research and just eats one meal a day, and then he does sports to stay healthy. I think that's really important. I loved working with him.

题八：The chanllenging Time

Perhaps this is a particularly stressful and challenging time for me because I'm struggling to manage all my tasks effectively. I have to prepare for my language test, write my statement of purpose and revise my CV, all of which take a lot of time and energy. However, I find it difficult to do everything at once, especially with the limited time I have. At first I thought I could manage it well. I thought it would be relatively easy to get an 8.0 on the test. But after taking the exam seven times, I've realised how difficult it really is. What frustrates me the most is that I still haven't passed the test, even though English used to be my strongest subject. Back in high school, I loved English and it was often the subject that boosted my overall grades. Now, however, this English test may even force me to take a gap year because I can't seem to pass it. I feel sad and very worried about my future. After doing an internship during my undergraduate studies, I found out that I don't like certain jobs, like working in journalism, which is closely related to my major. I also know that I don't want to take a job in marketing. My goal is to apply for a PhD program. Although it’s not easy for me, t I've told myself many times that it doesn't matter. Just take it easy and time will tell.

题九：Do you like to give others suggestion？ 

Honestly, I don’t particularly like giving others suggestions. The main reason is that everyone has their own unique experiences and backgrounds. Each person’s journey is different, and what works for one person might not necessarily work for someone else. I feel it’s difficult to give advice that truly suits someone else’s situation. For example, I used to be someone who loved asking others for advice. I remember once, I asked a senior whether I should pursue further studies. Their suggestion was based on their personal experience, and while it sounded reasonable, it didn’t entirely apply to my circumstances. Following their advice left me feeling uncertain, and I realized that their path wasn’t necessarily the right one for me. This experience taught me that while advice can be helpful, it’s important to understand your own goals and situation. That’s why I now prefer to share my experiences rather than offering direct suggestions. It’s up to others to decide what resonates with them. 

Emails and other communication tools offer convenience and efficiency. 
They allow instant messaging, file sharing, and real-time collaboration regardless of location. Emails provide a formal platform for professional communication, while tools like messaging apps enable quick and casual interactions, fostering better connectivity in both personal and professional contexts. 

题十：Describe a natural viewpoint in China 
One of the most scenic natural viewpoints in China is Wutong Mountain in Shenzhen, located in the eastern part of the city. As the highest peak in Shenzhen, it offers a panoramic view of the surrounding cityscape, the lush greenery of the mountain, and the distant coastline.

The summit of Wutong Mountain stands at 943 meters above sea level, providing an expansive view of Shenzhen’s urban landscape on one side and the tranquil, natural beauty of the surrounding forests on the other. From the top, you can see the sprawling city beneath, framed by towering mountains and the shimmering waters of the South China Sea in the distance. The hike to the peak is a popular activity, attracting nature enthusiasts and hikers who are eager to enjoy both the physical challenge and the beautiful surroundings. Along the trail, visitors encounter dense forests, peaceful streams, and a variety of wildlife, which makes the journey feel like an escape from the urban hustle.

What makes Wutong Mountain especially memorable is its peaceful atmosphere and the striking contrast between nature and the fast-paced city life below. The mountain offers a tranquil retreat where one can experience Shenzhen's natural beauty in a setting that's only a short distance from the city center.

I chose this viewpoint because it highlights the harmony between nature and urban life, offering a rare opportunity to enjoy both in a single location. The view from Wutong Mountain is not only breathtaking but also provides a sense of connection to the surrounding environment.

题十一：Where do you like to study? 

I prefer studying in quiet and focused environments, and my favorite place to study is a lab space at my university. Unlike a library, where it can sometimes feel a bit crowded or formal, the lab has this relaxed yet productive vibe that really works for me. It’s a space where I can spread out my materials, plug in my laptop, and dive into my work without distractions. What I enjoy most is the clarity it gives me. The lab is well-lit and organized, which helps me keep my thoughts in order. Plus, it’s free from noise or interruptions—I find that essential for deep concentration, especially when I’m working on complex research or writing assignments. I also like how it feels separate from my personal space. Studying at home can blur the lines between work and relaxation, but when I’m in the lab, I know I’m there to focus. Once I leave, I feel accomplished and ready to unwind, which creates a nice balance. It might not sound very exciting, but for me, a clear, quiet, and comfortable environment like this is exactly what I need to get the most out of my study time. 

题十二：Do you like study at cafe or library?

 I’d say it depends on the situation, but between the two, I’d lean towards the library. Libraries are quiet and focused, which is perfect for me when I need to dive deep into research or write something that requires a lot of concentration. The silence helps me stay in the zone, and I love being surrounded by shelves of books—it’s kind of inspiring! That said, I do see the appeal of studying in a café. Sometimes, the soft background noise and the smell of coffee can make the environment feel cozy and relaxed. If I’m working on something light, like brainstorming ideas or organizing my schedule, a café can be a refreshing change of pace. But if I had to pick, I’d choose the library. It’s like my go-to space when I really need to get things done. Cafés are nice for a bit of variety, but the library is where I’m most productive. As for how often I study in each place, I’d say I’m in the library most of the time. It’s the go-to spot, especially when I’m facing deadlines or need to concentrate deeply on a project. I probably spend around 80% of my study time there. The other 20% might be at a café, usually when I just need a change of scenery or when I’m doing more casual work, like reading articles or making plans. So, for me, it’s mostly about finding the right environment based on what I need to get done that day. When I need deep focus, the library wins; when I just want a bit of inspiration or a different vibe, I’ll head to a café. 

题十三：Shenzhen’s City Facilities 

Shenzhen is an incredibly well-developed city that blends modern infrastructure with a forward-thinking approach to urban living. One of the standout features is its transportation system. The Shenzhen Metro is a real marvel—it’s fast, clean, and connects almost every part of the city. I think it’s one of the most efficient subway systems in the world. It makes getting around so easy, whether you're commuting during rush hour or exploring the city at your own pace. Apart from that, the public buses and shared bikes are also excellent. The buses are frequent, and the bike-sharing system, especially in areas like Futian and Nanshan, offers a convenient way to explore the city while getting some fresh air.

As for facilities, Shenzhen is known for its towering modern skyscrapers and cutting-edge technological parks, but it also incorporates green spaces, making it unique. Places like Shenzhen Central Park and Lianhua Mountain provide peaceful escapes from the urban hustle. Shenzhen is also famous for its business district, such as the Futian CBD, and the impressive Ping An Finance Centre, which symbolizes the city's rapid economic development.

In terms of shopping, Shenzhen offers something for everyone. From the luxury shopping malls in the Huaqiangbei area to the vibrant street markets in Dongmen, the city caters to all tastes and budgets. The city’s infrastructure also includes top-tier medical facilities, excellent schools, and a wide range of cultural institutions like museums, theaters, and galleries, making it a well-rounded place to live and work.

Overall, Shenzhen is a city that knows how to balance modern living with green spaces, offering world-class facilities without sacrificing the quality of life.


题十四：Describe an important river/lake in your country
You should say:
Where it is located
How big/long it is
What it looks like
And explain why it is important

When I think of an important river in my country, the first one that comes to mind is the Zhujiang River, also known as the Pearl River. It is located in southeastern China and flows through five provinces, including my hometown. This personal connection has left me with a deep appreciation for its significance.

In terms of size, the Pearl River is one of the largest river systems in China, stretching across a significant portion of the country. Although I don’t know its exact length or total area, I do know that it spans about a quarter of the nation. Its surface is often calm and reflective, sometimes appearing as soft and fluffy as clouds or marshmallows—a sight so mesmerizing it feels almost edible!

The importance of the Pearl River cannot be overstated. Firstly, it sustains the livelihoods of millions of people living along its banks by providing clean water for drinking, farming, and daily activities. It also supports regional industries and businesses, making it a critical economic asset. Secondly, it offers a natural retreat for people seeking relaxation. The scenic views along the river serve as a peaceful escape, helping residents unwind and connect with nature.

In summary, the Pearl River is not just a waterway; it’s a source of life, a driver of economic growth, and a cultural treasure. Its role in supporting both the physical and emotional well-being of those who live near it makes it an indispensable part of my country’s identity.

【Keywords】
1. Description of the river/lake: Geographical location: Southeastern China, spans across provinces, flows through, situated in, stretches across.
2. Size/appearance: Vast, extensive, sprawling, reflective surface, pristine waters, lush surroundings, picturesque, tranquil, marshmallow-like, shimmering.
3. Significance: Lifeline, resource, economic backbone, cultural symbol, environmental treasure.
【Importance】
1.Utility: Drinking water, irrigation, transportation, industrial usage, livelihood support.
2.Cultural aspects: Heritage site, historical relevance, local identity, tourism attraction.
3.Emotional connections: Personal memories, recreational space, community bonding, inspiration.

1. How can rivers/lakes benefit local people?
I think the most important benefit is that rivers and lakes provide water, which is essential for maintaining people's basic needs. Water is the source of life, and without it, we couldn't sustain ourselves or thrive. In addition, rivers and lakes offer beautiful landscapes that can be enjoyed for relaxation and recreation, improving the quality of life for local communities.

2. Do you think rivers/lakes attract tourists?
Yes, definitely. Rivers and lakes are major attractions in many countries, including mine. For example, depending on the season—spring, summer, autumn, or winter—different rivers and lakes showcase unique views that draw tourists from all over the world. Each region’s waterways have their own charm, offering diverse experiences such as sightseeing, photography, and cultural activities.

3. How do rivers/lakes affect local tourism?
Rivers and lakes play a significant role in boosting local tourism. They often form the foundation for cultural stories and traditions that attract visitors. While different countries may have similar cultural elements, the natural landscapes are unique. For instance, a river can become a symbol of local identity and pride, inspiring festivals and events that draw both domestic and international tourists.

4. Are rivers/lakes good for transport? Why?
Absolutely, rivers and lakes are excellent for transport, especially in the past. Before the advent of trains and subways, waterways were vital for moving goods and people efficiently. Even today, water transport remains eco-friendly and sustainable, producing no pollution. Unlike cars, which harm the environment, rivers and lakes allow us to move in harmony with nature, preserving it for future generations.

5. What are the popular water sports in your country?
In my country, swimming is probably the most popular water sport. Others, like skating, surfing, and kayaking, are also quite common. However, swimming holds a special place, particularly because of its prominence in the Olympics. Chinese athletes have performed exceptionally well in swimming competitions, which has made the sport even more popular and inspired many people to take it up.

6. Are rivers/lakes important to a country?
Yes, rivers and lakes are incredibly important to any country. They serve as lifelines, providing water for drinking, agriculture, and industry. They are also critical during emergencies or natural disasters, as they often remain resilient. For example, while roads and other infrastructure can be easily damaged, water bodies are less affected and continue to be useful. Moreover, rivers and lakes help maintain ecological balance and support biodiversity, making them invaluable for both humans and nature.

Describe a way/change that helps you save a lot of time
You should say:
What it is
How you implement it
How difficult it is
And explain how you feel about the way/change  

Oh, when I saw the topic about a way that helps me save a lot of time, the first method that came to my mind is keeping away from smartphones. Nowadays, many young people, including myself, are often addicted to YouTube, smartphones, or other digital devices. This not only wastes a lot of time but can also negatively impact daily life.

That’s why I decided to make a change and develop strategies to limit my smartphone usage. For example, I started by setting clear boundaries. When I’m out for about 60 days or focusing on something important, I completely avoid unnecessary smartphone use. Instead, I prioritize activities that truly matter to me, like deepening my knowledge in academic research or improving myself—whether through practicing the piano or engaging in other productive hobbies.

If I need a break, such as during lunch or while cooking, I allow myself a short, controlled amount of time on my phone—around 15 minutes. After that, I consciously put it aside and return to what I was doing. This routine has been incredibly helpful in managing my time better.

However, implementing this change is not as easy as it sounds. Smartphones are highly addictive, and resisting the urge to use them requires strong self-discipline. On one hand, you know excessive use is a waste of time, but on the other hand, it’s hard to fight the constant temptation. The key is aligning your actions with your goals and reminding yourself of the more important things you could be doing.

Once I managed to stick to this plan, I felt incredibly relaxed and proud of myself. It gave me a sense of accomplishment and control over my time. I now feel like a more productive and powerful person because I overcame the inner laziness that used to hold me back.

1. What can people do to save time?

I think saving time requires both a mindset and action. People need to recognize the importance of time management first. Once they understand that wasting time can have serious consequences, they’ll likely take steps to change. However, the most difficult part comes when they realize this—they must take concrete actions to implement changes in their daily routines. Only then can they start managing their time effectively.

2. Does technology help people save time? How and why?

I think it depends on the person and the context. Technology can both help and hinder time management. For example, young people may find themselves wasting time on social media or digital games, which can be quite addictive. This certainly doesn’t help save time. On the other hand, professionals, especially in fields like IT or business, can benefit from advancements in technology, such as automation tools, which improve productivity and efficiency. So, in my opinion, technology’s impact on time management depends on how it’s used and by whom.

3. Do you think parents should be responsible for teaching children to save time?

Yes, definitely. There’s an old saying in China, "Parents are children’s best teachers," which highlights the importance of parents in shaping their children’s habits. Parents should teach their children about the value of time and help them develop time management skills. However, this responsibility doesn’t fall solely on parents. Schools, the children themselves, and society as a whole should also play a role in fostering this awareness.

4. Do people who can manage time well become successful more easily?

It’s difficult to give a definitive answer. While it’s often said that good time management leads to success, I don’t think it’s that simple. I've never seen any solid research or data directly linking time management with higher success rates. Success is a complex matter, influenced by many factors like skills, luck, and relationships. Time management is certainly important, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle.

5. Is it necessary for children to learn time management?

Of course. If children don’t learn time management, they could easily fall into bad habits like procrastination or spending too much time on distractions. In today’s world, they need to use their time wisely to develop their abilities and build good character. Learning time management will help them grow into better individuals and set a solid foundation for their future.

6. What can schools do to help students learn time management?

Schools can take several approaches to teach time management. Of course, lessons or workshops about the importance of time management can be helpful. However, I think the most effective way is for teachers to lead by example. If teachers manage their own time well, students can follow their lead. Additionally, schools should set clear expectations and rules about time management. Praising students who excel in this area can also motivate others to improve.

Describe a job that is useful to the society
You should say:
What job it is
How you know about this job
What types of people do this job
And explain why you think this job is useful to the society

One job that I find to be incredibly useful to society is that of a teacher.

I have encountered teachers at different stages of my life, from primary school to my graduate studies, and each one of them has significantly impacted me. For example, in primary school, my teacher was always warm and caring, taking time to support my emotional well-being. As I progressed to middle and high school, teachers became more focused on my academic growth, encouraging me to push myself further. In university, professors helped guide my research and intellectual development, which was crucial for my studies. They were not just instructors but mentors, guiding me through different life stages with advice, knowledge, and support.

Teachers who excel in this job tend to possess certain qualities. First, they need to be kind and compassionate, as they work closely with students and often play an emotional and supportive role in their lives. Second, they need to be knowledgeable in their field of expertise. Whether it's a subject like math, science, or literature, a teacher must have a deep understanding of the material they are teaching. Third, they should be clever and adaptable, as teaching requires the ability to think critically and creatively to engage students with diverse needs.

I recall a teacher from my primary school named Chris, who was exceptional. He ranked number one in the college entrance examination in China and later became a writer, contributing significantly to our local community. He was a pioneer in his field and was always dedicated to his students. His passion for teaching and his continuous pursuit of knowledge made him a standout educator and a great role model.

I believe teaching is incredibly useful to society because it shapes future generations. Teachers empower students with knowledge, critical thinking skills, and values, which they carry with them throughout their lives. Without teachers, we wouldn't have professionals in every field, from healthcare to engineering, to the arts. Teachers are instrumental in shaping the world’s future, and that is why I consider this job essential to society.

1. Why do people move from one place to another?
People move for various reasons depending on their life stage. For younger people, moving may be motivated by education or career opportunities, while for older individuals, it may be about retirement and finding a warmer climate. For adults in their prime working years, they may move to a different city in search of better job prospects, a new cultural environment, or an overall improved quality of life. The reasons for moving vary based on factors such as age, work, and family needs.

2. What should people prepare before they move to a different city?
Before moving to a new city, people should prepare in two key areas: culture and economy. Culturally, it’s important to understand the history, lifestyle, and social norms of the city. This can be done by reading books, watching documentaries, or talking to locals. Economically, it's essential to research the cost of living, including housing, transportation, and general expenses. Knowing how much money you will need and whether you can afford the lifestyle in your new city will help you plan better.

3. What kinds of places do people in your country prefer to live in?
In my country, the type of place people prefer to live in depends on factors such as gender, income level, and career goals. For instance, a report in China suggests that many women prefer living in the southeastern part of the country, where the culture is more open and there are more career opportunities. Men, on the other hand, often prefer cities like Beijing, as it is the political and economic center, providing them with more chances to influence decisions and gain power. So, preferences can vary based on personal goals, career aspirations, and cultural factors.

4. What are the benefits of living close to one's workplace?
Living close to one's workplace offers several benefits. First and foremost, it saves a lot of time and energy. Without long commutes, people can sleep longer, prepare for work, and enjoy a more relaxed start to the day. Additionally, living nearby reduces the stress of crowded transportation or traffic, making for a smoother daily routine. This can help improve both physical and mental well-being, allowing for a more balanced and productive life.

5. What factors make a city livable?
Several factors contribute to a city’s livability, with the most important being the natural environment. A clean and pleasant environment is essential for well-being. If a city is overcrowded, polluted, or has harsh weather, people may experience stress and discomfort, making it difficult to enjoy life there. The second important factor is the city’s cultural and historical aspects. A city with a rich cultural heritage allows residents to feel a sense of belonging. In my hometown, for example, although the city is modern and developed, it lacks a deep cultural history, which can make some people feel disconnected. So, both the natural environment and the cultural atmosphere play vital roles in a city’s livability.

6. Why do many people choose to move to big cities?
People choose to move to big cities for different reasons, often influenced by their age and circumstances. Younger people tend to move to big cities in search of better job opportunities, higher salaries, and career growth. For older individuals, big cities may offer better healthcare, retirement benefits, and senior care options. Many young people also move to big cities to be closer to their families or follow their parents' decisions. Ultimately, the reasons for moving to big cities are diverse and depend on personal needs, career goals, and family circumstances.

Describe a place you have been to and would like to recommend others to live there (not your hometown)
You should say:
Where it is
What the place is like
When you visited there
Who you went there with
And explain why you would recommend this place to others

Let me tell you about Boston, a city I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a place to live. Interestingly, I discovered it unexpectedly during a layover on my way to an academic conference. Those few days turned out to be far more exciting than I had anticipated.

Boston is located in the northeastern part of the United States. I visited in August 2024, during the summer. The weather was lovely, and the city had a vibrant yet relaxed atmosphere. During the conference, I was accompanied by friends and professors from various countries and cultural backgrounds. We bonded quickly as we explored Boston together, sharing our perspectives and learning from each other. I vividly remember one evening when we strolled along the Charles River, discussing art, science, and our personal experiences. Their company made the trip more enriching and memorable, as we not only enjoyed the city’s beauty but also deepened our connections through meaningful conversations.

One of the first places I visited was the Charles River. What stood out to me the most about Boston was its unique combination of culture, history, and education. The city is home to many prestigious universities, including Harvard and MIT, making it a hub of innovation and intellectual energy.

What makes Boston truly special for me, however, is the Charles River. The gentle sound of the water, combined with the city skyline in the distance, felt almost cinematic. It’s a place that brings a sense of peace and inspiration without even trying.

Boston is more than just a city—it’s where art, history, and innovation come together in perfect harmony. It’s inspiring and comforting at the same time. That’s why I would wholeheartedly recommend Boston as a great place to live.

What is the most helpful innovation at home?

From my perspective, the washing machine is the most helpful innovation at home. I think it’s incredibly important because it saves a lot of time and energy. In China, the weather can be very hot, meaning people need to shower and change their clothes daily. This results in a lot of laundry. Without washing machines, someone would have to wash all the clothes manually, which is a significant waste of time. The washing machine simplifies this task, making life much easier and more efficient.

What household appliances make us lazy?
Actually, I can’t really think of any household appliances that make us lazy. In my opinion, most household appliances are designed to make life more convenient rather than encourage laziness. For example, if you use a sweeping machine or a robot vacuum, you still need to oversee or accompany it to ensure the job is done properly. These machines can’t completely handle tasks on their own. So, I don’t believe household appliances make us lazy—they just help us save time and effort.

What kind of invention can be used at school?
The first invention that comes to mind is a chatbot. For example, my friend Julia is a typical introvert, and she feels nervous about talking to her tutor when she has questions. She once told me that if there were a chatbot in real-life situations, it could help her communicate with her tutor more easily. This way, she wouldn’t need to overthink whether to send an email or worry about how to phrase it. A chatbot could save her from unnecessary stress and make the communication process much smoother.

Do you think AI will replace human teachers? Why?
Not yet, especially not in the next 10 to 15 years. For example, when I have questions about my research or daily studies, I sometimes ask AI for help. While it often provides logical answers, its responses can lack cultural or contextual understanding, leading to errors. On the other hand, professors at my school rarely make such fundamental mistakes because they interpret materials more holistically and thoughtfully. Therefore, I believe AI cannot fully replace human teachers, especially in fields like art, social sciences, and other areas that rely heavily on human intelligence and cultural understanding.
