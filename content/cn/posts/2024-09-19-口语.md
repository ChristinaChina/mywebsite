个人情况：
目前不同场次的分差有1.5。
日常和教授、母语是英文的朋友的small talk交流没有什么问题。也就是说我的和科技、媒体、文化相关的词汇、观点积累得还行。
但同时：（1）面对运动类、自然景观等这种基础类的需要说个十分钟左右的，死宅回答不上一点。（2）碰到不太会的题目时，我的词汇最先会降下来，其次逻辑也会跟着降，再就是流利度也跟不上。


关键：
1. 交流感。考官是第一次见面的朋友，要有眼神的交流。
2. 流利度第一。脑子清晰。
3. 逻辑非常重要。衔接和论证，和作文没差。


PART1---流利性---两个句子---give a direct answer+ a reason or extra information
PART2---能保证6.5的分数表现是在(训练重点)
PART3---逻辑

雅思口语:框架式思考
从句，理清楚逻辑
为什么是这样回答的，这种回答还可以运用到哪些方面？

事物有不同的方面，事物也有不同的场合。
How does consumption impact the environment？
environment
air quality 空气质量
waste 废料
biodiversity 生物多样性
climate change 气候变化

1.可以谈论consumption对以上具体某一方面的影响
Yeah, consumption can definately impact the environment negatively.
I mean, every time we make a purchase, there is packaging that we instantly get rid of. And when we are done with the product, we just toss it out. So pretty much everything we consume eventually ends up in landfills, where all the waste is gonna contaminate the water and soil. 
Do you think it is importanat to be on time?
我的回答：Yeah, it is so significant to be on time. I mean, every time we attend class or meeting on the appointed time, we will make the event opperate smoothly. But if we don’t be an on time person, we may leave some bad impressions by the clssmates , workmates and leaders , causing losing some opportunities one day you need at the worse situation.
事物：
professional settings 专业场合
school settings 学校场合
personal settings 私人场合

2.可以谈论准时在某一个场合的好处
Certainly, punctually can pay off in a wide range of settings, especially in professional settings. Let’s say you are heading to a job interview. When you show up on time, it sends a clear message that you take the job seriously and you are dependable, which can tolly boost your chances of landing the job, right?



介绍和朋友是怎么认识的？
 We are both on the quiet side. So if we hadn’t ended up sitting next to each other, we probably wouldn’t have become friends. Because neither of us would have initiated a conversation. I just feel lucky that we got to sit together, which gave us a chance to chat and get to know each other a little bit.
 initiated a conversation 发起聊天，搭讪

# 一、话题
## 话题一：学习或工作
1.Do you work or are you a student
Currently, I am a student and will be graduating next year. But I am interested in academics so I am now preparing to apply for a degree program in another country.

2.What do you study and why did you choose it?
I majored in radio and television studies because I have a fascination with journalists since I were a junior student after watching a documentary about the role of the press.  At that time, I realy realise its humanistic care and culture. So after passing the examination of high school, I choose the radio and television studies as my college major and I can't wait to pursue it as a career in the future!


Is it a popular subject at your university?

Very popular! It is very popular among both teachers seeking tenure throughout eastern China and students who have just passed their high school examinations. For the former, the dean of my department receives numerous CVs from distinguished doctors who could join more prestigious schools in China. As for the latter, my subject ranks in the top 1%, which reflects not only its entrance standards and academic abilities but also its well-known reputation. So，yeah！It’s truly a desirable subject at my school!

do you enjoy studying it?
It is such a huge subject that there will always be parts you like and parts you don’t like. On the one hand, I find analysis of integrated media engrossing because it provides insight into what media does the real world need and enhance the critical thinking skills about traditional media. On the other hand, modules like the history of radia and television can be a little boring at times.


if you could change to another subject, what would it be?

Well, if I could switch gears, I would probably dive into cutural  Studies. It just like  an applied level discipline to a true understanding of the culture behind social mechanisms


## 话题二：job

## 话题三：hometown


## 话题四：home/ the area you live in 

Until October this year, I lived alone in a city in southern China, in a one-room apartment that was a bit cramped. But now I'm living with my family in a small city in Germany, in a small three-story villa with a garden, attic, very big windows, and two cute little dogs.

1. Do you have many neighbors?\
Me: Yes, I do! I live in an apartment building, so there are quite a few neighbors around. Most of them are friendly, and we occasionally greet each other or chat when we meet in the hallway or elevator. It’s nice to have people nearby, but at the same time, everyone respects each other’s privacy, which I really appreciate.

2. Is it a good idea to leave your keys with your neighbors?\
Yeah, sure! It’s reassuring to have my backed-up keys left to a trusted neighbor. If I ever go out for a long academic trip, I can just rely on it without worrying about the continued care of my plants and the wellbeing of my dog. Such a choice can provide a sense of peace of mind. 

## 话题五：family

## 话题六：your likes and diske
1.广告
（1）What kind of advertising do you like?\
I don't usually enjoy watching advertisements, but I would be interested in watching public service announcements that support education for underprivileged children and help improve their lives.

(2) Do you think these types of advertisements are effective in reaching their target audience?\
Maybe. I don't think so because I can't distinguish the objective audience that advertisement providers want to target. It could be aimed at wealthy or powerful individuals, but I'm not sure. I don't have much money as I'm just a student and lack power. However, I do have some cultural knowledge. I'm not sure if I am the target audience.

(3) Do you see a lot of advertising on trains or other transport in your area?\
In the past, especially during my childhood and younger years, I used to notice advertisements in public places like elevators, buses, and trains. However, as I got older, particularly when I started university about four years ago, I observed a decrease in public advertisements. I believe this is mainly due to the advancement of technology, with smartphones becoming widely popular. Many people are engrossed in their phones and may not pay attention to other advertisements. Advertisers may have recognized this shift in audience behavior and decided to focus their efforts elsewhere.

(4)  Is there an advertisement that made a strong impression on you when you were a child?\
The most impressive advertisement I have seen was a public advertisement in a remote Chinese village. It featured a poor girl who wanted to go to primary school to gain knowledge and have the same opportunities as others. The advertisement showed a photograph of the girl's eyes, symbolizing her desire to study. This advertisement sparked great social concern and many people, including myself as a child, donated money to help her. The girl eventually received a good education thanks to the support she received. It was a heartwarming story that made me very happy.

(5)How do you think advertisements like this can influence people's willingness to help others in need?\
I believe there are several reasons contributing to the widespread influence of public service advertisements. The most significant reason, in my opinion, is that they aim to help those in need without seeking profit. Another crucial factor is the content of the advertisements, such as the use of photographs, colors, and visuals, which all play a role in their success. These two reasons are key in how public service advertisements can assist those in need.

(6)How do you feel about the role of social media in advertising today? Do you think it has changed the way we perceive ads?\
Yes, social media has a significant influence on our daily lives, including advertising. One major impact is the decline of traditional media advertising, leading them to adapt and compete with social media platforms. Another aspect is how social media appeals to and engages younger audiences, influencing their preferences and spending habits.

题型一：Describe a Special Day That Costs You Little Money

One of the most memorable and special days in my life was my graduation day, which didn't cost me much but left a lasting impression on me.

The day started with a simple ceremony at the university. It was a moment of celebration, but also one of reflection. I walked across the stage to receive my diploma, and the cheers from my friends and family made it even more special. Although the event itself wasn’t extravagant or overly expensive, the pride I felt in completing my degree was priceless.

After the ceremony, my professor invited a small group of us to a modest yet heartwarming meal at a local restaurant. The meal wasn’t fancy at all—it was more about spending time with people who had supported us throughout our academic journey. It was a chance to express our gratitude and talk about our future aspirations. The warmth of the occasion and the camaraderie shared with my classmates and professors made the meal incredibly meaningful.

What made the day even more special were the heartfelt messages I received from younger students, including some of my juniors who had looked up to me. They took the time to send me well wishes, and their kind words made me feel appreciated and connected to the university community in a deeper way. It was a reminder of how much I had grown during my time there and how my presence had made a difference to others.

Overall, while the day didn’t require spending a lot of money, it was full of emotional value. The joy I felt came from the experiences and relationships built during my university years, and I will always cherish the memories of that day.



题型二：Describe a Long Walk That You Ever Had

One of the longest and most unforgettable walks I’ve ever had took place in July during my trip to New Zealand. It was a glacier hike on the Franz Josef Glacier, which is one of the most famous glaciers in the country. July was in the middle of New Zealand’s winter, so the conditions were particularly challenging, but the experience was absolutely worth it.

I went on this hike with my senior from university, and we both eagerly looked forward to the adventure. We were dressed in multiple layers, but the cold was still intense, and the chill of the glacier was something I had never experienced before. As we began the hike, the icy winds were so biting that I could feel my face going numb, and the cold seeped through even the thickest layers of clothing.

The path we walked on was a mixture of ice, snow, and rocks, which made it tricky to maintain balance. We had to wear crampons to avoid slipping, and our guide instructed us carefully on how to navigate the glacier safely. The walk was long—lasting about six hours—but it was physically demanding, especially due to the altitude and cold weather. Breathing felt heavier at times, and the thin, cold air made it a little harder to catch my breath.

Despite the challenging conditions, the scenery was absolutely mesmerizing. The glacier itself was vast, and we walked through narrow ice tunnels, crossed small crevasses, and marveled at the stunning blue ice formations. We took a few breaks, huddling together to warm up for a moment, and the whole experience felt both exhilarating and peaceful at the same time. We could hear the soft creaking and cracking sounds of the ice, which added to the otherworldly atmosphere.

My senior and I talked along the way, exchanging stories about our experiences and encouraging each other to keep going. The hike was tough, but sharing the journey with someone made it feel more manageable. The cold and exhaustion were difficult to push through, but when we finally reached a viewpoint with a panoramic view of the glacier and surrounding mountains, it felt like we had conquered a small world of our own.

The entire hike was physically demanding, but it was also a chance to test my limits and enjoy the beauty of the natural world. It was an unforgettable adventure, and even though we were both exhausted by the end, we both agreed that the experience was one of the highlights of our trip to New Zealand.


Describe a time you received money from a family member:
You should say:
1.when you received it
2.why you received it
3.what you did with the money

and explain how you felt after receiving it



【Spoken English】I don’t come from a very wealthy family, so I’ve never been given a huge amount of money in my life. The only time I can remember being given a significant amount of money was for my first Holy Communion. I’m Irish, I’m from a Catholic background, and if you grew up Catholic, when you’re around seven, eight years old, you do your first Holy Communion. It’s like a big milestone in a child’s life. Normally, family member will give you some money. I think at the time I was given between 40 and 50 pounds. So in the late 80s, early 90s, I can’t remember exactly when that was, early 90s, that was a significant amount of money. But I actually reminded my mother the other day that she took that money from me. I said she stole it from me. And her response was, well, we didn’t have any money, so I stole it from you to buy you food and to buy your clothes. So I di feel quite aggrieved at the time because a lot of my richer friends were going and buying toys and things like that. It was the first time I’d ever had a significant amount of money, and then it was taken from me right away. But looking back now, it fills me with gratitude. I’m very grateful that it happened because it shows how much my mother struggled and how hard she worked for me in order to set me up in life. Recently, my little boy did his first Holy Communication, and he got a lot more than I got. He wasted it on buying things in a computer game. It was a good opportunity for us to teach him about not wasting money. Now he wants to buy more things in the computer game, but I told him that he has to work for it and he has to do some jobs around the house if he wants that.
