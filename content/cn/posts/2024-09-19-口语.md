个人情况：
目前不同场次的分差有1.5。
日常和教授、母语是英文的朋友的small talk交流没有什么问题。也就是说我的和科技、媒体、文化相关的词汇、观点积累得还行。
但同时：（1）面对运动类、自然景观等这种基础类的需要说个十分钟左右的，死宅回答不上一点。（2）碰到不太会的题目时，我的词汇最先会降下来，其次逻辑也会跟着降，再就是流利度也跟不上。


关键：
1. 交流感。考官是第一次见面的朋友，要有眼神的交流。
2. 流利度第一。脑子清晰。
3. 逻辑非常重要。衔接和论证，和作文没差。

雅思口语:框架式思考
从句，理清楚逻辑
为什么是这样回答的，这种回答还可以运用到哪些方面？

事物有不同的方面，事物也有不同的场合。
How does consumption impact the environment？
environment
air quality 空气质量
waste 废料
biodiversity 生物多样性
climate change 气候变化

1.可以谈论consumption对以上具体某一方面的影响
Yeah, consumption can definately impact the environment negatively.
I mean, every time we make a purchase, there is packaging that we instantly get rid of. And when we are done with the product, we just toss it out. So pretty much everything we consume eventually ends up in landfills, where all the waste is gonna contaminate the water and soil. 
Do you think it is importanat to be on time?
我的回答：Yeah, it is so significant to be on time. I mean, every time we attend class or meeting on the appointed time, we will make the event opperate smoothly. But if we don’t be an on time person, we may leave some bad impressions by the clssmates , workmates and leaders , causing losing some opportunities one day you need at the worse situation.
事物：
professional settings 专业场合
school settings 学校场合
personal settings 私人场合

2.可以谈论准时在某一个场合的好处
Certainly, punctually can pay off in a wide range of settings, especially in professional settings. Let’s say you are heading to a job interview. When you show up on time, it sends a clear message that you take the job seriously and you are dependable, which can tolly boost your chances of landing the job, right?

Do you like rainy days?
Yeah 100%. Rainy days give me the perfect excuse to stay in and relax at home. I am a total homebody you know.（说出隐含意义）I definitely enjoy just chilling indoors when it’s raining dogs and cats. It’s the best time to watch a movie or get lost in a good book. It’s the best time to watch a movie or get lost in a good book.
是的我超喜欢。

介绍和朋友是怎么认识的？
 We are both on the quiet side. So if we hadn’t ended up sitting next to each other, we probably wouldn’t have become friends. Because neither of us would have initiated a conversation. I just feel lucky that we got to sit together, which gave us a chance to chat and get to know each other a little bit.
 initiated a conversation 发起聊天，搭讪

Topic 1: Study or Work
1.Do you work or are you a student
 I am currently a full-time student at Shenzhen University.

2.What do you study and why did you choose it?
I majored in radio and television studies because I have a fascination with journalists since I were a junior student after watching a documentary about the role of the press.  At that time, I realy realise its humanistic care and culture. So after passing the examination of high school, I choose the radio and television studies as my college major and I can't wait to pursue it as a career in the future!


Is it a popular subject at your university?

Very popular! It is very popular among both teachers seeking tenure throughout eastern China and students who have just passed their high school examinations. For the former, the dean of my department receives numerous CVs from distinguished doctors who could join more prestigious schools in China. As for the latter, my subject ranks in the top 1%, which reflects not only its entrance standards and academic abilities but also its well-known reputation. So，yeah！It’s truly a desirable subject at my school!

do you enjoy studying it?
It is such a huge subject that there will always be parts you like and parts you don’t like. On the one hand, I find analysis of integrated media engrossing because it provides insight into what media does the real world need and enhance the critical thinking skills about traditional media. On the other hand, modules like the history of radia and television can be a little boring at times.


if you could change to another subject, what would it be?

Well, if I could switch gears, I would probably dive into cutural  Studies. It just like  an applied level discipline to a true understanding of the culture behind social mechanisms

谈论一个朋友/明星/

谈论更喜欢在图书馆还是喜欢在哪里学习
更喜欢一个人学习还是一个人学习

【作业】Is it a good idea to leave your keys with your neighbors?
Yeah, sure! It’s reassuring to have my backed-up keys left to a trusted neighbor. If I ever go out for a long academic trip, I can just rely on it without worrying about the continued care of my plants and the wellbeing of my dog. Such a choice can provide a sense of peace of mind. 


【对抗焦虑】

Do you prefer to save money or spend money?
I would definitely go for saving money. It’s reassuring to have some cash set aside. If I ever encounter a situation where I need to a huge amout of cash, I  can just rely on it without worrying about taking out a loan. It can really give me peace of mind. 

1.提出观点：让人安心。It’s reassuring to have sth.
2.具体解释：If I ever do sth.（列举一种情况），I can just rely on it without worrying about sth.（不好的结果）
3.结论：让人高枕无忧（回归观点，完成逻辑闭环）

Describe something you do to help you study or work.
You should say:
What it is
How you learn it
When you do it
And how you feel about the method

e.g. make a to-do list
(回答 how you feel about the method)

It’s reassuring to have  a to-do list to help me stay organized. If  I ever hove a ton of tasks to complete and I feel overwhelmed, I can rely on it without worrying about forgetting anything important.It can really help me peace of mind.

What do you think of in-car GPS navigation systems?
I think they are a godsend. It’s reassuring to have a GPS system to help you navigate. If you ever get lost, you can just rely on it without worrying about heading in the wrong direction. It can really give you peace of mind.
