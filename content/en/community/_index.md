Exploring the fascinating world of digital journalism and media culture has been a true privilege, especially in the company of passionate companions such as my supervisor, research group colleagues, senior students, and fellow undergraduates. During my time at the Digital Media Culture Laboratory and the Center for Covergent Global Communication, our shared curiosity transformed us from research partners into close friends

The Digital Media Culture Laboratory operates as a Guangdong Provincial Higher Education Innovation Team Project, led by the my advisor Professor Chang. This initiative seeks to investigate issues beyond the fog of media, with the objective of uncovering truth, authentic knowledge, and the fundamental principles of culture (Chinese: 透过媒介迷雾，探寻文化的真相、真知与真理).
