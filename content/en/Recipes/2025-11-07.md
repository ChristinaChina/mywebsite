# 🍎 Apple Roasted Chicken & 🌶 Spicy Shredded Chicken

Originally, I planned to make only Apple Roasted Chicken. However, as I started preparing, I realized that time was a bit tight and I wouldn't finish everything in one go. To make the most of the leftover roasted chicken, I decided to create a second dish: Spicy Shredded Chicken with Parsley. This way, I could enjoy a quick, flavorful dish from the leftovers while adding a fresh and spicy twist. The combination of sweet roasted apple flavors and the vibrant, herby shredded chicken makes for a satisfying two-part meal.

## 🍎 Recipe 1: Apple Roasted Chicken

### Ingredients
- 1400g corn chicken  
- 1–2 apples, sliced or chopped  
- Scallions  
- Ginger  
- Salt  
- Olive oil or cooking oil  

### Instructions

1. **🧂 Prepare the chicken**  
   Clean the chicken thoroughly. Rub salt all over the inside and outside. Let it sit for 15–20 minutes to absorb flavor.  

2. **🍏 Prepare the apples**  
   Core and cut the apples into slices or chunks.  

3. **🍎 Stuff apples into the chicken**  
   Insert the apple pieces into the chicken cavity. Place the chicken in a roasting pan and scatter scallion and ginger pieces around it so the aroma can infuse the meat.  

4. **🛢 Oil the chicken**  
   Brush the chicken surface with olive oil or cooking oil. Sprinkle a little extra salt if desired.  

5. **🔥 Roast**  
   Preheat the oven to 200°C (390°F). Roast the chicken for 45–60 minutes depending on size and oven type. Turn or baste halfway to ensure even browning.  

6. **⏱ Rest**  
   Remove from oven and let it rest for 5 minutes to allow juices to redistribute. Then cut or carve for serving.  

> **💡 Tip**: Stuffing apples inside the chicken adds sweetness and aroma. Adjust roasting time based on the chicken size.

## 🌶 Recipe 2: Spicy Shredded Chicken with Parsley (from leftover roasted chicken)

### Ingredients
- Leftover roasted chicken (~1400g or part of a whole chicken)  
- Scallions  
- Ginger  
- Chili peppers (fresh or dried, to taste)  
- Parsley, a generous amount (chopped)  
- Salt (to taste)  
- Cooking oil  

### Instructions

1. **🍗 Tear the chicken**  
   Break leftover roasted chicken into large pieces. Remove bones if preferred.  

2. **🔥 Blanch in hot water**  
   Boil water in a pot, add ginger and scallion pieces. Put the chicken pieces in for 1–2 minutes to remove excess fat and any strong flavor.  

3. **❄️ Ice water cooling**  
   Remove the chicken and place in ice water for 2–3 minutes to firm up the texture.  

4. **✋ Shred the chicken**  
   Pull the chicken apart along the grain into strips or chunks.  

5. **🌿 Season with parsley and chili**  
   - Finely chop scallions, ginger, chili peppers, and a generous amount of parsley  
   - Mix with salt or chicken seasoning powder  
   - Pour hot oil over the shredded chicken and mix well to coat evenly  

> **💡 Tip**: Parsley adds freshness and aroma. Adjust chili amount to your preferred spiciness. If the chicken seems dry, extend the blanching time slightly or add a little chicken stock to keep it moist.

## 📌 Notes
- The Apple Roasted Chicken can be made in advance, and leftovers work perfectly for the Spicy Shredded Chicken with Parsley.  
- Adjust chili and parsley amount according to taste.  
- Ice water cooling makes chicken texture firmer, especially for shredding.
