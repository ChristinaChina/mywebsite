# Ingredients
Approximately 200g of pork
100g of mushrooms
Salt (used in small amounts)

# Steps
1. Soak the pork (purchased from Tegut) in water overnight, around 10 hours.
2. Cut the pork into strips and the mushrooms into slices.
3. Stir-fry the pork strips in a pan. In a separate pot, blanch the mushrooms briefly.
4. After about 10 minutes of stir-frying the pork, add the mushrooms to the pan.

Season with a small amount of salt, as I prefer to keep it light for better digestion, especially since I eat out often.
