# Ingredients
1. Beef shank bone or pork ribs: appropriate amount
2. Carrot: 3-4 (cut into chunks)
3. hiitake mushrooms: 8–10
4. Mushroom shreds: to taste
5. Ginger slices: 3–5 pieces
6. Goji berries: to taste

# Instructions
1. Blanching (Removing Impurities):
    (1) Place beef shank bone or pork ribs in a pot of cold water. Add a few ginger slices and bring to a boil over medium heat.
    (2) Once foam rises to the surface, blanch for 10–15 minutes. Remove the bones or ribs, rinse thoroughly under cold water, and set aside.
2. Simmering the Soup:
    (1) Transfer the blanched bones or ribs into a soup pot. Add enough water to cover them.
    (2) Toss in the carrot chunks, sliced shiitake mushrooms, mushroom shreds, and ginger slices.
    (3) Simmer on low to medium heat (level 3 on a scale of 1–6) for about 3 hours.
3. Adding Flavor: 
Season the soup with salt to taste. Add goji berries in the last 30 minutes of cooking to preserve their sweetness and nutrients.
4. Taste and Serve: Adjust seasoning as needed before serving. The soup is ready to enjoy!

# Tips
1. To enhance the sweetness of the soup, add more carrots or goji berries.
2. Beef shank bone produces a richer, gelatinous broth, ideal for long simmering. Pork ribs create a lighter, clearer soup suitable for pairing with other ingredients.
3. Leftover broth can be refrigerated and used as a versatile soup base for other dishes.

# Personal Notes
I’ve previously made this recipe with beef shank bones, and the resulting soup was rich and flavorful. This time, I tried using pork ribs but found the taste relatively mild and less impressive. If you prefer a robust broth, beef shank bones are the way to go, while pork ribs are better suited for light soups.
