# Ingredients
1. 1 piece of beef shank slices (Rinderbeinscheibe)
2. Salt and black pepper (to taste)
3. 2 tablespoons olive oil or butter
4. 2 sprigs fresh rosemary or thyme (optional)
5. 50ml red wine (optional, for flavor)
6. 1 egg
7. 2 tomatoes (sliced)

# Instructions
1. Prepare the Beef Shank
   (1) Rinse the beef shank slices and pat them dry with paper towels.
   (2) Season both sides with salt and black pepper, gently massaging the seasoning into the meat. Let it rest for 10 minutes.
At first, you might think this cut of beef would be better suited for a slow-cooked stew, as it's tough and contains bone. But after trying it, you might be surprised—it holds up well with a pan-sear and still delivers great flavor!

2. Pre-cook the Beef Shank (Optional, for Tenderness)
In a pot, add enough water to submerge the beef shank slices, and add ginger and green onion slices.
Bring it to a boil, then reduce to a simmer for 1 hour until the meat becomes tender but still attached to the bone. Remove and drain the meat.
3. Pan-Searing the Beef Shank
Heat a skillet over medium heat and add olive oil or butter. Once hot, place the beef shank slices in the pan.
Sear the first side for 2-3 minutes until golden brown, then flip the slices and sear the other side for another 2-3 minutes.
Add the sliced garlic and herbs (rosemary or thyme) to the pan, sautéing until fragrant.
4. Season and Finish (Optional)
If you like a richer flavor, add 50ml of red wine or a little beef broth to the pan, stirring quickly.
Let it simmer on low heat for 2 minutes to let the sauce reduce and thicken, allowing the meat to soak in the flavor.
5. Fry the Eggs and Tomatoes
In a separate pan, add a little oil and heat over medium-low.
Crack the eggs into the pan and cook them sunny side up or to your desired doneness. Season with salt and pepper.
In the same pan, add the sliced tomatoes and cook for 1-2 minutes until softened. You can season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
6. Plate and Serve
Place the beef shank slices on a plate, topped with the pan sauce (if you made it).
Add the fried eggs and tomatoes on the side.
# Tips
1. Chewy Texture: If you prefer a more chewy texture, you can skip the pre-cooking step and pan-sear the beef shank slices directly.
2. Fried Eggs: Cook the eggs to your preferred doneness, whether you like them runny or fully cooked.
3. Tomatoes: The slight sweetness and acidity of the tomatoes balance the richness of the beef, making it a perfect pairing.
