# Ingredients
1. Carrot slices
2. Mashed potatoes
3. Ground beef
4. Bell peppers
5. Noodles
6. Salt

# Cooking Steps
1. Multitask with three pans
Pan 1: Heat over medium-low heat (level 2). Sauté carrot slices until soft, then add mashed potatoes. Mix well, season lightly with salt, and simmer on low heat.
Pan 2: Simultaneously, bring water to a boil in another pot and cook the noodles for about 10 minutes until tender. Drain and set aside.

2. Cook the ground beef and bell peppers
Pan 3: Heat on high, add a small amount of oil, and stir-fry the ground beef for 3 minutes until browned. Add bell pepper slices and cook for 30 seconds, then remove from heat and set aside.

3. Combine ingredients
Transfer the sautéed carrot slices, mashed potatoes, and cooked noodles into the pan used for the ground beef. Stir everything together to absorb the flavor of the pan.

4. Plate and finish
Serve the mixed noodles on a plate and top with the ground beef and bell peppers. Adjust the salt to taste.
