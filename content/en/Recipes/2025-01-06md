# Ingredients
1. 100g beef (cut into strips or thin slices)
2. 1 small celery stalk (sliced thinly)
3. 1/2 bell pepper (cut into strips, any color)
4. 1 tsp cooking oil
5. Salt to taste

# Steps
1. Prep the ingredients
Slice the beef into strips (accidentally or intentionally!).
Thinly slice the celery and bell pepper into strips for uniform cooking.

2. Cook the beef
Heat 1 tsp of oil in a small pan over medium-high heat.
Add the beef and stir-fry for about 2 minutes until browned and cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside.

3. Stir-fry the vegetables
In the same pan, add the celery and stir-fry for 1 minute.
Toss in the bell peppers, sprinkle with a pinch of salt, and stir-fry for 30 seconds.

4. Combine and finish
Return the beef to the pan and stir-fry everything together for about 1 minute.
Add 1 tbsp of water, stir to coat, and let the flavors meld briefly.

5. Serve
Plate and enjoy hot, with or without steamed rice, for a quick and flavorful meal.
