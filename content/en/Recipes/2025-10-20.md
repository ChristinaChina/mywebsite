## Instructions

1. **🧼 Prepare the tofu**  
   - Drain the tofu and pat it dry.  
   - Cut into bite-sized cubes.  

2. **🌶 Prepare the chili**  
   - Finely chop fresh chili or crush dried chili flakes.

   - Beat until smooth.  

4. **🍲 Dip tofu into egg**  
   - Place several tofu cubes directly into the egg mixture.  
   - Stir gently so the tofu pieces are fully coated with the egg and chili mixture.  

5. **🔥 Fry the tofu**  
   - Heat a non-stick pan or wok over medium heat and add cooking oil.  
   - Pour in the egg-and-tofu mixture.  
   - Cook, stirring occasionally, until the egg sets and the tofu is golden and slightly crispy.  

6. **🥄 Serve**  
   - Transfer to a plate and serve hot.  
   - Can be enjoyed as a snack, side dish, or part of a main meal.  

> **💡 Tip**:  
> - Using firm tofu helps it hold shape in the egg.  
> - Adjust chili to your taste for mild or spicy flavor.  
> - Optional: add a dash of soy sauce or garlic powder for extra flavor.
