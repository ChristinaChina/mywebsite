# Ingredients
1. Beef brisket 500 g, cut into large cubes (blanched in hot water and rinsed)
2. 3 tomatoes (1 tomato, finely chopped; 2 tomatoes, sliced)
3. Light soy sauce 1–1½ tbsp
4. Salt, to taste
5. Garlic powder, a small pinch
6. Ginger powder, a small pinch

# Instructions
1. Start the pot (no oil, no frying)
   - Place the blanched beef into a pot
   - Add the chopped tomato
   - Pour in hot water until the beef is covered by 2–3 cm
2. Bring to a boil
   - Cook on medium heat (level 6)
   - When the water boils, skim off any foam
   - Once bubbling steadily, reduce the heat
3. Slow simmer
   - Lower the heat to low–medium (level 3–4)
   - Cover with a lid
   - Let it simmer gently for 60–90 minutes (30 minutes in a pressure cooker)
   - The surface should show small bubbles, not a rolling boil.
4. Season
   - When the beef is tender:
     Add soy sauce
     Add salt
     Sprinkle a small pinch of garlic powder and ginger powder
     Stir gently
5. Add tomato slices
   - Add the sliced tomatoes
   - Simmer on low heat (level 3) for another 10–15 minutes
6. Serve
   - Taste and adjust salt if needed
   - The soup should be light, tomato-forward, and clean in flavor
   - Best served with plain rice 🍚
# Notes
1. Add garlic/ginger powder near the end to avoid bitterness
2. If the soup tastes slightly sour, simmer a little longer—the tomatoes will mellow naturally
3. This version is closer to a tomato beef soup than a rich braise
4. If you want, I can also rewrite this as:
   - a very minimal “3-ingredient” version, or
   - a pressure cooker / rice cooker version, or
   - a more Western-style tomato beef stew (still no frying)
