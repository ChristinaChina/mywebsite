# Ingredients
1. 500g bok choy
2. 1-2 tablespoons oil
3. Salt (to taste)
4. Optional: chicken bouillon or mushroom seasoning

# Instructions
1. Prepare the Bok Choy
（1）Wash the bok choy thoroughly and separate the stalks from the leaves.
（2）Cut the stalks into even pieces for quick cooking; keep the leaves whole or cut them slightly if large.
2. Blanching (Optional)
（1）Bring a pot of water to a boil, add a pinch of salt and a few drops of oil.
（2）Blanch the stalks for 20 seconds, then add the leaves and blanch for another 10 seconds.
（3）Drain and rinse with cold water to retain their bright green color (this step can be skipped if preferred).
3. Stir-Fry
（1）Heat a wok or skillet with the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and stir-fry until fragrant.
（2）Add the bok choy stalks first and stir-fry on high heat for about 30 seconds until slightly tender.
Add the leaves and stir-fry quickly until evenly mixed.
4. Season and Finish
（1）Add salt to taste (and optional chicken or mushroom seasoning). Stir-fry for another 10 seconds.
（2）For a slightly saucy dish, add 1-2 tablespoons of water and simmer for 10 seconds before finishing.
5. Serve
Transfer to a plate and serve hot.
