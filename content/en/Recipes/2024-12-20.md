# Ingredients
Salmon fillet
Black pepper
Cucumber

# Steps
1. Sprinkle black pepper on the surface of the salmon and let it sit for 15 minutes to allow the flavor to marinate.
2. Place a layer of sliced cucumber at the bottom of the baking tray. The cucumber will help absorb the fish's oil and add a fresh contrast.
3. Preheat the oven to 175°C (350°F). Place the salmon in the oven and bake for 15 minutes (adjust the time based on the thickness of the salmon).
