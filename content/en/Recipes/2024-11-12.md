# 🍽 About This Blog

---
Since I started studying abroad, my routine have changed a lot. Sometimes I just have to cook for myself, and that’s how this little recipe blog came to be. I wanted a place to keep track of the dishes I’ve made and jot down what worked (or didn’t!).  

The main idea is simple: to help me **look back on my cooking experiments** so I can easily recreate them later. But if you like cooking too, feel free to use it as a little reference or inspiration.  

I usually cook **Cantonese, Japanese, Thai, and Korean food**, and sometimes I try Sichuan dishes or other flavors. Most of my dishes are on the lighter side, but every now and then I like a bit of **sour-spicy or sweet-spicy** action to mix things up.  

One thing to know: these recipes are all based on what I like. I try to **keep things simple and use as few seasonings as possible**, so you get the natural taste of the ingredients. The goal is simple: **healthy, easy, and tasty food**.
