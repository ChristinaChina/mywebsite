Data merging and splitting are commonly used techniques for organizing and analyzing data more effectively. For example, merging data from different sources or splitting data based on certain variables to make comparisons or analyses more specific.

# Data Splitting (Split File)

Data splitting means dividing the dataset into subsets based on certain criteria, such as gender, GPA, or any other variable. This is useful for analyzing the data within different groups.

Let's assume we want to split the data based onGPA (Grade Point Average), categorizing students into two groups: high GPA group (GPA ≥ 3.5) and low GPA group (GPA < 3.5).

## Steps

1.Open the Data File:
   - Ensure that the dataset is loaded into SPSS.

2.Select "Data > Split File":
   - In the menu bar, go to `Data > Split File...`.

3.Choose the Splitting Variable:
   - In the dialog box that opens, select a variable to split by. Here, we choose `GPA` as the splitting criterion.

4.Customize the Split Conditions:
   - If you want to split based on GPA values (e.g., GPA above or below 3.5), you can create a new computed variable:
     - Go toTransform > Compute Variable and create a new variable called `GPA_group`, defining the conditions:
       - If `GPA >= 3.5`, then `GPA_group = 1` (High GPA Group).
       - Otherwise, `GPA_group = 0` (Low GPA Group).

5.Click OK:
   - Once done, click OK, and SPSS will split the data into two parts based on your defined criteria.

## Result After Splitting
The dataset will be split into two groups, and any subsequent analyses will be performed separately for each group. For example, descriptive statistics and frequencies will be calculated for each group individually.

# Data Merging (Merge Files)

Data merging refers to combining data from different sources into a single dataset. To merge datasets, there needs to be at least one common variable (e.g., `Student_ID`) in both datasets.

Let's assume you have two datasets:
1. `student_performance.sav` — Contains student performance data.
2. `student_demographics.sav` — Contains student demographic information.

## Steps:
1.Open the Primary Data File (e.g., `student_performance.sav`):
   - Open the main dataset you will be working with in SPSS.

2.Select "Data > Merge Files > Add Variables...":
   - In the menu bar, go to `Data > Merge Files > Add Variables...`.

3.Choose the Second Dataset:
   - In the dialog box, click “Browse” to select the second dataset (e.g., `student_demographics.sav`).

4.Choose the Key Variables for Merging:
   - Select the common variable between the two datasets (e.g., `Student_ID`).
   - Make sure this variable is chosen as the key for merging.

5.Click OK:
   - After clicking OK, SPSS will merge the two datasets by the `Student_ID` variable. All the information from `student_demographics.sav` will be added to `student_performance.sav`.

## Result After Merging
The merged dataset will now contain information from both files. For example, the demographic information (such as parental education level, household income) from `student_demographics.sav` will be added as new variables in the `student_performance.sav` dataset.


# Summary

Data Splitting (Split File): This allows you to divide the data into separate groups based on one or more variables, which is useful for performing separate analyses for each group.
-Data Merging (Merge Files): This combines different datasets based on a common variable, extending the dataset with additional information.
