This research was presented orally at the ICA. It is closely connected not only to my own experiences as a woman but also to my long-term engagement in this digital fieldwork. The project focuses on the working practices of digital feminists in China. This study is significant for several reasons: on the one hand, it helps reveal how feminists organize, disseminate ideas, and engage in social practice within digital spaces, thereby enriching our understanding of contemporary gender practices in China; on the other hand, it explores the interactions between digital technologies and social movements, providing new perspectives for understanding social action, public discourse, and gender politics in the digital era. By combining personal experience with fieldwork observation, I am able to gain a deeper understanding of the strategies, methods, and social impacts of digital feminist practices, while laying a foundation for further research in this area. Compared to my previous presentation, I approached this session with greater composure, feeling more confident and at ease in sharing my insights.
