Chinese culture is replete with a plethora of intangible cultural heritage, teeming with resplendent historical recollections and profound cultural tenets. It constitutes an invaluable component of our collective heritage. Nevertheless, in the contemporary era, a plethora of promising avenues are emerging to safeguard these priceless intangible competencies from being eroded. In a novel approach, some intangible heritage inheritors are charting a unique course by integrating traditional skills with contemporary media communication in innovative and engaging ways. This remarkable documentary provides a comprehensive examination of the exceptional experience of an NGT inheritor. He does not merely adhere to the techniques inherited from his parents; he also assumes the initiative of joining an MCN (Multi-Channel Network) organization. By organizing and leading a professional team, he has established a highly regarded account, "Intangible Bamboo Weaving," on the Jittery Voice platform. The account has amassed an impressive 3.874 million subscribers and a total of 38.931 million likes. The account is achieving remarkable results. It is facilitating a novel understanding of non-heritage cultures. Moreover, it is revitalizing traditional skills in a novel manner. The account is attracting a significant number of younger users.

In Chinese culture, the term "craftsmen" is used to describe individuals who have attained a high level of proficiency in a particular skill and utilize it as a source of income. They transmit traditions through their manual dexterity and document history through their technical expertise, which is a truly remarkable phenomenon to observe. Nevertheless, in the context of the contemporary emphasis on economic growth and mobility, these artisans are confronted with a set of unprecedented challenges. They are demonstrating an admirable resilience and adaptability in responding to these circumstances. In the context of rapid change, how might these artisans maintain their livelihoods? The question thus arises as to how these craftsmen can maintain the quality of their work and the mission of their heritage in the face of the gap between tradition and the market. Our documentary film, "Hands of Artists," takes an inspiring approach to this issue. We focus on the incredible survival of this group in the era of modernity. Our objective is to answer the question of how traditional craftsmen can establish a connection with modern society. We would be grateful to hear the thoughts of this remarkable inheritor.
