Barbie Zelizer's seminal 1993 article, *"Journalists as Interpretive Communities,"* published in Critical Studies in Mass Communication, introduced a framework that reconceptualizes journalists not merely as professionals bound by formal norms but as members of a community shaped by shared discourses and collective interpretations of key events (Zelizer, 1993). Drawing on Stanley Fish's literary theory, Zelizer argued that journalists form an interpretive community through the repeated narration and reinterpretation of pivotal moments, such as the Kennedy assassination and Watergate scandal. These narratives serve to reinforce group identity, authority, and legitimacy, even amid factual disagreements, by establishing a "professional lore" that transcends individual experiences.

Nearly three decades later, Zelizer revisits and expands this idea in her 2022 article, "What Journalism Tells Us About Memory, Mind and Media," published in Memory, Mind & Media (Zelizer, 2022). Here, the interpretive community concept is embedded within a broader exploration of journalism's ontological relationship to time and memory. Zelizer employs Erving Goffman's dramaturgical metaphor of frontstage and backstage performances to illustrate how journalists navigate temporal demands in an era of perpetual urgency, characterized by crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, racial violence, and climate emergencies (Goffman, 1959). On the frontstage, journalists publicly enact normative speed-oriented practices, such as immediacy and liveness, to affirm their role as society's real-time chroniclers. Backstage, however, more granular temporal activities unfold, including mnemonic routines like analogies, retrospectives, and self-corrections, which allow the community to adjust to ontological precarity.

This integration reveals how interpretive communities function temporally. In the 1993 piece, collective interpretation is primarily discursive, building solidarity through shared stories of past events. The 2022 article extends this by positioning temporality as journalism's core ontology, where memory acts as a corrective mechanism against the depletion of time as a finite resource (Reich & Godler, 2014). For instance, Zelizer analyzes cases like the Los Angeles Times' self-examination of its racist history and the Washington Post's erroneous COVID-19 reporting, showing how backstage mnemonic work, such as apologies and retractions, repairs frontstage errors and sustains community cohesion. These practices echo the 1993 emphasis on narrative as identity-formation but add a multidimensional temporal layer, incorporating prospective memory (anticipating future adjustments) alongside retrospective recall.

The fusion of these works underscores journalism's potential as a model for other institutions facing similar ontological uncertainties. In an age of information overload, where speed dominates public discourse, Zelizer suggests that embracing complex time, through interpretive communities' mnemonic flexibility, enables adaptation. This perspective shifts journalism studies from static professionalism to dynamic socio-temporal processes, inviting scholars to explore how media, mind, and memory intersect in addressing contemporary crises.
