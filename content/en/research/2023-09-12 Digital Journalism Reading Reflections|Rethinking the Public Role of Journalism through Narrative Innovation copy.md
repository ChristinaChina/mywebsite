Reading this Journalism & Communication (《新闻界》) 2023(6) article, my strongest takeaway is that generative AI should not be treated as a simple upgrade of journalistic tools. Its impact is not confined to efficiency gains, faster workflows, or increased content production. Rather, it reaches into journalism’s epistemic foundations, professional ethics, and the very definition of what it means to be a journalist. In this sense, generative AI is not adding functionality from the outside but reshaping the profession from within.

## From journalistic labor to systemized news production
One of the article’s most important contributions is its insistence on shifting the discussion from what AI can do to what journalism becomes once AI is embedded in its routines. In the period before generative AI, automation in areas such as financial reporting or sports recaps largely involved clearly bounded tasks with relatively stable inputs and manageable accountability. Generative AI, however, enters journalism as an assistant and gradually spreads across topic selection, question design, drafting, editing, distribution, audience interaction, fact checking, and multimodal transformation. News production increasingly resembles a system shaped jointly by models, platforms, and data infrastructures rather than a linear workflow.

This transformation has direct implications for professional identity. Journalists are no longer only writers or gatekeepers but are increasingly positioned as operators and calibrators of complex sociotechnical systems. As reliance on model generated summaries, structures, and stylistic suggestions grows, many forms of implicit professional judgment are quietly delegated to probabilistic mechanisms. The article’s argument that the transformation extends beyond functionality into conceptual and structural dimensions is therefore convincing. Once journalism becomes system driven, the profession must confront the question of who defines relevance, credibility, and visibility, and according to which logics.
Data driven storytelling and the reconfiguration of publicness
The article argues that generative AI restructures key journalistic mechanisms, including newsgathering, production, distribution, interaction, and misinformation detection, while simultaneously accelerating multimodal and visual storytelling. This should not be understood as a purely technical shift. It represents a deeper reconfiguration of journalism’s public logic.

Personalized distribution and conversational interfaces make news increasingly resemble a customized information service. While this may improve relevance and audience engagement, it also draws journalism toward a consumer oriented logic. Public issues are fragmented into individualized preference profiles, and social complexity is compressed into visually appealing and emotionally reactive summaries. The article’s concern about news becoming shorter and shallower is therefore not nostalgic. It raises a fundamental issue. If news increasingly circulates as simplified audiovisual fragments, shared reference points for collective public deliberation may erode. Faster circulation does not necessarily entail deeper understanding.

## Rethinking professional norms beyond objectivity
The article carefully documents the limitations of generative models, including bias, hallucination, lack of semantic understanding, and the production of misleading or discriminatory outputs. It calls for cautious use, transparency, traceability, authorship disclosure, and new forms of citation. What stands out to me is that the central issue is no longer whether AI should be used, but whether journalism can establish a renewed professional baseline grounded in explainability, accountability, and auditability.

I strongly agree with the article’s position that generative AI should be treated as a semi finished product rather than a final one. From the perspective of someone nearing the end of doctoral training, generative AI functions best as a probabilistic drafting and exploration tool. It expands possible directions and accelerates early stages of writing, but it cannot replace journalism’s core practices. These include responsible engagement with reality, fieldwork, relationship building, ethical judgment, and critical questioning of power.

## Redefining the journalist beyond data management
The article’s emphasis on news as a form of social practice is particularly compelling. As journalism increasingly relies on algorithms to identify patterns from social media streams and large datasets, journalists risk being repositioned from embodied investigators to data managers. This is not merely a change in skill requirements but a transformation of professional identity. Yet the most valuable dimensions of journalism remain contextual and relational. They involve understanding how power operates, how fear circulates, how silence is produced, and what individuals experience when they become subjects of news coverage.

While models can process information efficiently, they cannot bear the ethical responsibility embedded in these relationships. From this perspective, the long term value of journalists does not lie in writing that resembles human expression, but in their capacity for presence, judgment, and responsibility.

Reframing a technological debate as a journalism studies agenda
Many current discussions of generative AI remain focused on toolkits, workflow optimization, or industry guidelines. The strength of this article lies in its refusal to remain at that level. Instead, it redirects attention to the central concerns of journalism studies, including news values, professional legitimacy, role ethics, and public responsibility. Its conclusion that generative AI will exert conceptual and structural influence rather than merely functional impact can be read as a research agenda rather than a final claim.

The questions that follow are not simply whether AI improves journalism, but how concepts such as truth, evidence, and transparency are redefined when production is mediated by models. They also include who becomes more visible and who becomes easier to marginalize, how mobilization driven news reshapes ethical boundaries, and how power relations are reorganized among journalists, platforms, models, and data infrastructures.
From the standpoint of someone close to completing a PhD, this article serves as a reminder that journalism studies should not merely react to technological change. Its responsibility is to provide normative language and frameworks of accountability as journalism evolves. Generative AI may make journalism faster, but scholarly work must ensure that it does not become shallower, lighter, or less responsible in the process.
