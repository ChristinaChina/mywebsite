# Opening
Hello everyone, I'm Zhenting. It’s an honour to present the institutional feminism section today. Today, I will give you an overview of the <a href='https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2023/07/sigi-2023-global-report_a65d7f7f/4607b7c7-en.pdf' target="_blank">Social Institutions and Gender Index 2023</a >, which measures gender equality across countries. But what makes SIGI unique is that it doesn’t just look at wages or employment—it looks at how social institutions, like laws and cultural norms, affect women’s opportunities.

# Part 1: Overview of SIGI 2023
Let’s start with the basics.
SIGI stands for the Social Institutions and Gender Index, created by the OECD. Unlike typical measures, SIGI looks at the root causes of inequality. It examines biased laws, traditions, and social norms that hold women back.
How does it measure discrimination?
- The 2023 SIGI uses a scale from 0 to 100. Zero means no discrimination, the ideal scenario. One hundred means the highest discrimination.
- SIGI evaluates discrimination across four key dimensions. (Show chart on PPT – pause 10 seconds)
- In short, SIGI shows us where discrimination is embedded in institutions, beyond just economic outcomes.
Global Trends
- The average SIGI score worldwide is 29, which means discrimination is still a serious issue.
- Even in countries with progressive laws, cultural practices and social norms continue to restrict women.
- In regions like South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, women face severe economic barriers and gender-based violence.
- Some ongoing issues include child and forced marriage, limited access to reproductive health, and greater vulnerability due to conflict or climate change.

# Part 2: How SIGI Works
Let’s look at the methodology behind SIGI.
## Data Sources
- SIGI uses three main sources:
Legal data—from national laws and international treaties.
- Official statistics—from organizations like the UN and World Bank.
- Social surveys—gathering public attitudes and beliefs about gender roles.
## Core Methodology
- SIGI compares laws with reality. A country may have gender-equal laws, but social norms may still hold women back.
- Some areas are weighted more heavily, such as family discrimination, because of their greater impact.
- Data is cross-validated to ensure accuracy.
## Structure
- Country Overview: snapshot of laws, traditions, and practices.
- GID-DB: a database with 33 indicators tracking family laws, civil rights, and more.
- Composite Index: combines sub-indices to score 108 countries.
### Five Sub-Indices
- Discriminatory Family Code – marriage, divorce, inheritance.
- Restricted Physical Integrity – sexual violence, FGM, abuse.
- Son Preference – biases favoring sons in health, education, wellbeing.
- Restricted Access to Resources – property, credit, land.
- Restricted Civil Liberties – voting, movement, freedom of expression.
### Advantages and Limitations
- Advantages: SIGI gives in-depth insights, compares laws to reality, and applies globally.
- Limitations: data gaps, difficulty measuring social norms, challenges in assessing law enforcement.
# Part 3: Family-Related Issues
## Child Marriage
- Still prevalent in over 36 countries, mainly in Africa and Asia.
- Impacts: disrupted education, early pregnancies, increased vulnerability to domestic violence.
- Household Responsibilities
Women spend 4.7 hours per day on unpaid household work, while men spend only 1.8 hours.
- Women usually manage daily chores and childcare, even when men help.
## Inheritance & Divorce
- 36 countries still deny women equal inheritance rights.
- Divorce can involve unequal legal procedures, economic hardship, domestic violence, and limited reproductive rights.
## Discussion Question
- SIGI’s “divorce” category lacks clarity. Does it reflect structural discrimination?
- Divorce systems often reinforce economic, legal, and social disadvantages for women.
# Part 4: Regional Comparison
## East Asia vs. Western Europe
   - East Asia:
      - China – medium-low SIGI score; laws strong, but workplace discrimination persists.
      - Japan – medium score; enforcement weak, cultural norms limit women.
      - South Korea – medium-high; conservative culture, high gender wage gap.
   - Western Europe:
      - Germany, UK, France – low SIGI scores; strong laws, policies, and social support for women.
# Key Findings
   - Legal equality does not guarantee real equality. Social norms continue to restrict women.
   - Nordic countries lead in gender equality. South Asia and Africa face the greatest challenges.
# Part 5: Policy Recommendations
To improve gender equality, we need to:
- Strengthen enforcement of laws.
- Promote gender equality education and awareness.
- Provide economic support to women, such as business loans and job training.
# Conclusion
The SIGI 2023 Index is more than a measurement tool—it’s a guide for shaping global gender policies. By understanding where barriers exist, we can take concrete steps toward a more equal world.

Thank you.
