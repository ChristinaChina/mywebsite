## 1. Conceptualization

- **Definition:** Textual analysis is a qualitative method for exploring the layered meanings, ideologies, and socio-cultural constructs embedded in texts (Belsey, 2013; Fairclough & Fairclough, 2015).  
- **Purpose:** It enables scholars to examine both explicit content and implicit social, cultural, and political messages, revealing how meaning is produced, circulated, and interpreted (Burrows, 2004; Fairclough, 2003).  
- **Scope:** Texts can include written, visual, audio, and digital media, making the method highly adaptable across disciplines such as media studies, cultural studies, sociology, political science, and communication (Hall, 1997; Kress & van Leeuwen, 2006).  

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

- **Literary Criticism:** Early textual analysis focused on literary works, emphasizing style, rhetoric, and cultural significance (Belsey, 2013).  
- **Discourse Analysis:** Explores how texts reflect and construct social realities and power relations (Fairclough, 2003; van Dijk, 1997).  
- **Structuralism and Post-Structuralism:** Structuralism views language as a system of signs, while post-structuralism highlights multiple interpretations and ambiguities (Hall, 1997).  
- **Digital/Text Mining Approaches:** Recent computational methods allow analysis of large-scale textual data for patterns, sentiment, and discourse structures (Burrows, 2004).  

## 3. Methodological Workflow

1. **Research Question Formulation**  
   Define clear, specific, and researchable questions (Fairclough & Fairclough, 2015).  
   - *Example:* “How do different news outlets frame responsibility in a social issue?”

2. **Text Selection and Collection**  
   Gather texts that are representative, relevant, and accessible (Belsey, 2013; Silverman, 2015).  
   - Sources may include news articles, political speeches, social media posts, advertisements, films, and multimedia content.

3. **Coding and Analysis**  
   - Establish categories, themes, and variables.  
   - Apply systematic coding and interpretive techniques to uncover patterns, meanings, and rhetorical strategies (Titscher et al., 2000).  
   - Optionally combine with quantitative methods (e.g., frequency analysis, sentiment scoring) to enhance rigor (Burrows, 2004).

4. **Interpretation and Synthesis**  
   - Connect findings to theoretical frameworks and prior research.  
   - Compare across texts to identify similarities, divergences, and contradictions.  
   - Reflect critically on methodological limitations and researcher subjectivity (Fairclough, 2003).  

## 4. Strengths

- **Flexibility:** Applicable to multiple text types and media (Belsey, 2013; Kress & van Leeuwen, 2006).  
- **Depth of Insight:** Reveals latent socio-cultural, ideological, and political meanings (Fairclough & Fairclough, 2015).  
- **Interdisciplinary Utility:** Widely used in media studies, cultural studies, political science, and beyond (Burrows, 2004).  

## 5. Limitations

- **Subjectivity:** Different researchers may interpret texts differently (Silverman, 2015).  
- **Representativeness:** Limited or biased samples can affect conclusions (Titscher et al., 2000).  
- **Resource Intensity:** Manual analysis is time-consuming, though computational tools can mitigate this (Burrows, 2004).  

## 6. Conclusion

Textual analysis offers a versatile, rigorous approach for understanding the production, circulation, and interpretation of meaning in texts. Its evolution from literary studies to critical discourse analysis and computational approaches demonstrates both conceptual depth and methodological adaptability. By integrating theoretical grounding with systematic analysis, researchers can uncover complex social, cultural, and political patterns, while remaining reflexive about methodological limitations (Fairclough, 2003; Belsey, 2013; Burrows, 2004; Fairclough & Fairclough, 2015).
