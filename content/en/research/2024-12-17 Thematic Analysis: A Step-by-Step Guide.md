# Introduction

Thematic Analysis (TA) is a flexible and systematic qualitative analysis method used to identify, analyze, and report patterns (themes) in textual data. This article draws on the theoretical foundations of Braun & Clarke (2006/2012) and Clarke & Braun (2017) to outline the application of TA.

# Overview of the Procedure

1. Raw Data 📝  
   - Data type: Social media texts/comments  
   - Example:  
       - "The newly built city square sculpture is very modern, but I feel it lacks cultural vibes."

2. Familiarize Yourself with Data 🔍  
   - Read the texts repeatedly to form an overall impression  
   - Take initial notes and mark keywords  
   - Example keywords: modern, lacks cultural vibe

3. Generate Initial Codes 🏷️  
   - Label segments of text  
   - Example codes:  
     - "Strong sense of modernity"  
     - "Lacks cultural atmosphere"

4. Search for Themes 🔗  
   - Aggregate related codes into potential themes  
   - Example theme:  
       - "Evaluation of Public Art Aesthetics"

5. Review Themes ✅  
   - Check whether themes cover all codes  
   - Adjust, split, or merge themes if needed  
   - Example adjustment:  
       - Include both "strong sense of modernity" and "lacks cultural atmosphere" under "Evaluation of Public Art Aesthetics"

6. Define and Name Themes ✏️  
   - Write clear definitions and assign names to themes  
   - Example:  
     - Name: Evaluation of Public Art Aesthetics  
     - Definition: Public evaluations and opinions on the aesthetic characteristics and cultural connotations of urban public art (e.g., sculptures, installations, architecture)

7. Write the Report 📄  
   - Organize analysis by themes  
   - Provide textual quotes as support  
   - Example quote:  
      - "The newly built city square sculpture is very modern, but I feel it lacks cultural vibes." → supports the theme "Evaluation of Public Art Aesthetics"

# Detailed Steps and Practical Tips

| Step | Key Actions | Practical Tips |
|------|------------|----------------|
| Familiarize with Data | Read social media comments multiple times to form an overall impression | Mark emotional words, aesthetic evaluation points (modernity, cultural sense, design, etc.) |
| Generate Initial Codes | Assign short labels to each segment | Examples: "strong sense of modernity", "colorful impact", "lack of cultural depth" |
| Search for Themes | Aggregate similar codes into potential themes | Use tables or mind maps to visualize relationships |
| Review Themes | Check if themes cover all codes and adjust structure | Ask peers or advisors to review for reliability |
| Define and Name Themes | Write clear definitions and precise names | Theme names should directly reflect public aesthetic concerns |
| Report Writing | Organize content by themes and provide quotes | Include representative text segments for each theme to enhance persuasiveness |

## Example of Complete Analysis Process

Raw Data Segments (Weibo or Forum Comments)  
- "The design of this newly built bridge is very avant-garde, but I feel it is a bit cold and lacks city characteristics."  
- "The square sculpture is colorful, but it does not match the surrounding environment."

Analysis Steps Example

1. Familiarize with Data  
   - Highlight keywords: avant-garde, cold, lacks city characteristics, colorful, not matching environment  

2. Generate Initial Codes  
   - Example codes: strong modernity, emotional coldness, lack of cultural sense, bright colors, environmental mismatch  

3. Search for Themes  
   - Group related codes into potential theme: "Evaluation of Public Art Aesthetics"  

4. Review Themes  
   - Check if the theme covers all codes and adjust/split if necessary  

5. Define and Name Theme  
   - Name: Evaluation of Public Art Aesthetics  
   - Definition: Public evaluation of aesthetic characteristics, emotional expression, and cultural connotations of urban public art  

6. Report Writing  
   - Quote original text to support themes  
   - Analyze public aesthetic preferences and interactions in digital media culture  

# Summary and Recommendations

- Theoretical Basis: Braun & Clarke (2006/2012) provide the methodological framework; Clarke & Braun (2017) emphasize theoretical stance and transparency  
- Operational Use: Flowcharts and examples help researchers systematically generate themes  
- Applicability: Suitable for aesthetic research, urban public art, architectural aesthetics, visual culture, and digital media text analysis  
- Practical Advice:  
  - Start coding with a small dataset, then expand to larger datasets  
  - Use tools (Excel, Notion, NVivo) to record codes  
  - Choose precise theme names that reflect public aesthetic concerns  
  - Iterate multiple times to ensure close alignment between data and themes
