# Qualitative Research Methods Overview

This page provides an integrated and detailed overview of three core qualitative research methods: **Textual Analysis**, **Fieldwork (Ethnography)**, and **In-Depth Interviews**. It includes conceptualization, data sources, analysis workflow, strengths, limitations, and practical examples. This document is designed for reference and comparison in academic research.

## 1. Methods Overview

| **Aspect** | **Textual Analysis** | **Fieldwork / Ethnography** | **In-Depth Interviews** |
|------------|--------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| **Core Idea** | Investigates layered meanings, ideologies, and socio-cultural constructs in texts. Focuses on interpretation of how texts produce, circulate, and reflect social/cultural/political realities (Belsey, 2013; Fairclough & Fairclough, 2015). | Immersive study of social groups or communities to understand behaviors, rituals, and lived experiences (Hammersley & Atkinson, 2019; Spradley, 1980). | Systematic, focused conversations to explore individual experiences, perceptions, and meanings in depth (Rubin & Rubin, 2012; Kvale & Brinkmann, 2015). |
| **Data Sources** | Written documents, visual media, audio/video, digital content, advertisements, social media, news reports, films (Burrows, 2004; Kress & van Leeuwen, 2006). | Direct observation in natural settings, participant interaction, field notes, artifacts, audio/video recordings (Emerson et al., 2011). | One-on-one interviews (semi-structured or open-ended), audio/video recorded and transcribed (Seidman, 2019). |
| **Engagement** | Non-participatory; researcher interprets texts and analyzes patterns and meaning. | Active participation in daily life and observation; long-term immersion. | Researcher engages in guided conversation; short- to medium-term engagement per participant. |
| **Analysis Workflow** | 1. Define research question (Fairclough & Fairclough, 2015) <br> 2. Text selection and collection (Belsey, 2013) <br> 3. Coding & thematic analysis; optional quantitative support (Titscher et al., 2000; Burrows, 2004) <br> 4. Interpretation and synthesis linking to theory (Fairclough, 2003) | 1. Select site & define research question (Hammersley & Atkinson, 2019) <br> 2. Participant observation and field notes <br> 3. Coding and thematic analysis <br> 4. Reflexive interpretation in context (Emerson et al., 2011) | 1. Define research question & select participants (Kvale & Brinkmann, 2015) <br> 2. Develop interview guide <br> 3. Conduct interviews & transcribe <br> 4. Thematic/narrative analysis; identify patterns across cases (Rubin & Rubin, 2012) |
| **Strengths** | - Flexible across text/media types (Belsey, 2013) <br> - Reveals socio-cultural, ideological, political meanings (Fairclough & Fairclough, 2015) <br> - Cross-disciplinary use (Burrows, 2004) | - Context-rich, holistic understanding of social settings (Spradley, 1980) <br> - Captures group-level practices and interactions (Hammersley & Atkinson, 2019) <br> - Adaptive to dynamic environments | - Deep insight into individual beliefs, motivations, and experiences (Seidman, 2019) <br> - Access to sensitive or private information <br> - Detailed subjective understanding |
| **Limitations** | - Subjectivity affects reliability (Silverman, 2015) <br> - Sample representativeness may bias conclusions (Titscher et al., 2000) <br> - Time- and labor-intensive (Burrows, 2004) | - Time-consuming; requires access and trust (Hammersley & Atkinson, 2019) <br> - Context-specific; limited generalizability (Geertz, 1973) | - Limited contextual or social interaction data <br> - Interviewee bias, selective recall <br> - Smaller sample limits generalizability |
| **Typical Applications** | Media framing studies, cultural discourse analysis, social media content analysis, visual communication research | Workplace culture, community rituals, online/offline social interactions, urban ethnography | Career trajectory studies, identity formation, decision-making processes, personal narratives |

## 2. Method Details

### A. Textual Analysis
- **Purpose:** Understand how texts construct meaning, ideology, and social norms.
- **Examples of Texts:** Newspaper articles, tweets, advertising campaigns, film scripts, political speeches.
- **Practical Tip:** Combine qualitative thematic analysis with keyword frequency or sentiment analysis for richer insights.
- **Case Example:** Analyzing how different media outlets frame climate change responsibility (Fairclough, 2003).

### B. Fieldwork / Ethnography
- **Purpose:** Capture holistic, context-dependent social practices.
- **Techniques:** Participant observation, field notes, interviews within the field.
- **Duration:** Often requires weeks to months to gain trust and understand dynamics.
- **Case Example:** Studying workplace culture in a startup to understand informal communication patterns (Emerson et al., 2011).

### C. In-Depth Interviews
- **Purpose:** Access detailed personal experiences and perceptions.
- **Techniques:** Semi-structured or open-ended interviews, followed by transcription and thematic coding.
- **Best Practices:** Prepare an interview guide, ensure rapport, and probe for depth without leading responses.
- **Case Example:** Investigating how young professionals perceive career opportunities in the gig economy (Seidman, 2019).
