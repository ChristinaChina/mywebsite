Framework: Analysis of Coffee and Tea Buying Preferences in Five Australian Cities

Introduction: The bar chart compares coffee and tea purchasing behaviors across five Australian cities, illustrating the proportions of residents who bought fresh or instant coffee and those who visited cafés or consumed tea within the past four weeks.

Group 1: External Differences
Why group?
This group is based on the commonality of café visits, which reflect a preference for convenience.

Key features and comparison:

The data shows that visiting cafés for coffee or tea was notably more common than purchasing fresh or instant coffee in most cities.
Sydney, Melbourne, and Hobart saw over 60% of residents frequenting cafés, while Brisbane's figure was about 55%.
Adelaide stands out as the exception, where just under 50% of residents visited cafés—slightly lower than the proportion who bought instant coffee.
Group 2: Internal Differences
Why group?
This group focuses on purchasing coffee, which distinguishes preferences for instant versus fresh coffee.

Key features and comparison:

Around half of the population in each city (45–55%) preferred instant coffee, with Sydney and Melbourne showing the smallest gap between instant and fresh coffee buyers.
In contrast, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Hobart had a significantly lower number of residents purchasing fresh coffee, accounting for roughly half the number of those who bought instant coffee.
Conclusion (Bonus: Additional Insights)
Additional interpretation:
Overall, the data suggests that residents across all five cities lean toward convenient options like visiting cafés or purchasing instant coffee rather than brewing fresh coffee at home. This trend indicates a preference for convenience in daily coffee and tea consumption.
