# One-Way ANOVA (Single-Factor Analysis of Variance)

Definitions:
- Independent Variable (Categorical Variable): This is the factor or grouping variable. In One-Way ANOVA, this variable should be categorical, representing different groups (e.g., different treatment types, different gender categories).
- Dependent Variable (Continuous Variable): This is the variable that is measured or observed. The values of this variable are expected to differ depending on the levels of the independent variable (e.g., test scores, weight, income).

Types of Variables:
- Categorical and Ordinal Variables: Always treated as independent variables.
- Interval/Ratio Variables: Treated as dependent variables.
- Ordinal Variables: Often treated as categorical when they are the independent variable.

 Key Difference Between Independent Samples t-test and One-Way ANOVA

- Independent Samples t-test: Compares the means of two groups.
- One-Way ANOVA: Compares the means of three or more groups.

While t-tests can compare differences between two groups, One-Way ANOVA can be used when there are multiple groups (e.g., comparing the mean test scores of students from different teaching methods or comparing income levels across different job categories).

 Assumptions of One-Way ANOVA:
1. Independence of observations: The data from each group must be independent of the data from the other groups.
2. Normality: The dependent variable should be approximately normally distributed for each group.
3. Homogeneity of variance: The variance among the groups should be roughly equal (tested using Levene's Test).

 Hypothesis Testing in One-Way ANOVA:
- Null Hypothesis (H0): All group means are equal. There is no significant difference between the means of the groups.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): At least one group mean is different from the others.

Test Statistic: 
The F-statistic is the key test statistic in ANOVA. It is calculated by comparing the variance between the groups to the variance within the groups. The formula for the F-statistic is:
\[
F = \frac{\text{Variance Between Groups}}{\text{Variance Within Groups}}
\]
A higher F-value indicates that the group means are more different from each other.

# One-Way ANOVA - Practical Application

Case Study:
Suppose we are interested in comparing the test scores of students who used different study methods (e.g., online, in-person, and mixed methods).

- Independent Variable: Study Method (categorical with three levels: Online, In-Person, Mixed)
- Dependent Variable: Test Scores (continuous variable)

Steps:

1. Data Input:
   The data would include the study method used and the test scores for each student. The study method would be treated as the independent variable, and the test scores would be treated as the dependent variable.

2. Perform One-Way ANOVA:
   - In SPSS, go to Analyze > Compare Means > One-Way ANOVA.
   - Place Test Scores as the dependent variable and Study Method as the factor.
   - Click Options to choose descriptive statistics and homogeneity tests, such as Levene's test.
   
3. Set Significance Level:
   Choose a significance level of 0.05.

4. Run the ANOVA and Interpret the Output:
   SPSS will output the F-statistic, p-value, and post-hoc tests (if necessary).

   - F-statistic: Indicates the ratio of variance between the groups to the variance within the groups.
   - p-value: If the p-value is less than 0.05, you reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in test scores between at least two study methods.

 SPSS Output Example:

| Source               | Sum of Squares | df  | Mean Square | F      | Sig.  |
|----------------------|----------------|-----|-------------|--------|-------|
| Between Groups       | 4500           | 2   | 2250        | 12.5   | 0.001 |
| Within Groups        | 5500           | 147 | 37.4        |        |       |
| Total                | 10000          | 149 |             |        |       |

Interpretation:
- F-value: 12.5
- p-value: 0.001

Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the test scores across the three study methods.

 Post-hoc Tests:

If the One-Way ANOVA shows a significant difference, we need to perform post-hoc tests to determine which specific groups are different from each other. Common post-hoc tests include:
- Tukey's HSD (Honest Significant Difference)
- Scheff√©'s Test
- Bonferroni Correction

These tests help identify which pairs of groups are significantly different after finding a significant result in ANOVA.

# Summary

One-Way ANOVA is a powerful statistical test used to compare the means of multiple groups. It is especially useful when you have one independent categorical variable and one dependent continuous variable. The test helps to determine whether the differences between group means are statistically significant, and it can be followed by post-hoc tests to identify the specific differences between the groups. Using SPSS, the analysis can be done efficiently, and the results can guide important decisions based on the differences between group means.
