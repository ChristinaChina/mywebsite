In statistical analysis, the Independent Samples t-test is used to compare the means of two independent samples to determine if there is a significant difference between them. When you have a binary categorical variable (e.g., gender, smoking status) and a continuous variable (e.g., income, age), you can use the Independent Samples t-test to check whether the means of these two independent samples are equal.

 # Mean Comparison - Independent Samples t-test - Comparing Means of Binary Variables

The Independent Samples t-test is used in the following situations:
- You have two distinct groups (e.g., male vs female, smokers vs non-smokers) and want to compare their mean values on a continuous variable (e.g., salary, height).
- This test is suitable for binary categorical variables (e.g., gender, whether or not received training) and continuous variables (e.g., salary, test scores).

Hypothesis Testing:
- Null Hypothesis (H0): The means of the two independent samples are equal (no significant difference).
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The means of the two independent samples are not equal (there is a significant difference).

 # Independent Samples t-test - Independent-Samples T Test

Steps:
1. Choose Variables: Identify the binary categorical variable (e.g., gender: male and female) and the continuous variable (e.g., income, score).
2. Set Hypotheses:
   - H0: The means of the two groups are equal.
   - H1: The means of the two groups are not equal.
3. Calculate t-value: The formula for the t-value is:
   \[
   t = \frac{(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}
   \]
   Where \(\bar{X}_1\) and \(\bar{X}_2\) are the means of the two groups, \(s_1^2\) and \(s_2^2\) are the variances of the two groups, and \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are the sample sizes.

4. Choose Significance Level: Typically, a significance level of 0.05 is chosen.

5. Compare p-value:
   - If the p-value is less than 0.05, reject the null hypothesis, indicating a significant difference between the two groups.
   - If the p-value is greater than 0.05, do not reject the null hypothesis, indicating no significant difference between the two groups.

 # Independent Samples t-test - Practical Application

Case Study:
Suppose we want to compare men and women in terms of their income. The data is as follows:

| Gender | Income (in thousands) |
|--------|-----------------------|
| Male   | 15, 18, 20, 17, 19     |
| Female | 12, 14, 13, 15, 16     |

Steps:
1. Input Data:
   In SPSS, we would input gender as the binary categorical variable and income as the continuous variable.
   
2. Perform the Independent Samples t-test:
   - In SPSS, navigate to Analyze > Compare Means > Independent-Samples T Test.
   - Place Income in the Test Variable(s) box and Gender in the Grouping Variable box.
   - Click Define Groups, and assign 1 for males and 2 for females.
   
3. Set Significance Level:
   - Set the significance level to 0.05.

4. Run the Test and Interpret the Output:
   SPSS will output the t-test results, including the t-value, degrees of freedom (df), and p-value.

SPSS Output Interpretation:
- If the p-value is less than 0.05, it indicates a significant difference in income between men and women, and we reject the null hypothesis.
- If the p-value is greater than 0.05, it indicates no significant difference in income between men and women, and we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

---

 Case Interpretation:

Suppose we get the following output from SPSS:

- t-value: 2.37
- Degrees of Freedom (df): 8
- p-value: 0.039

The p-value is 0.039, which is less than 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in income between men and women.

# Summary

The Independent Samples t-test is an important method for comparing the means of two independent samples to determine if there is a significant difference between them. By using SPSS, we can easily perform the t-test and interpret the results. Understanding how to run the test and interpret the output is crucial for successfully applying the t-test in practice.
