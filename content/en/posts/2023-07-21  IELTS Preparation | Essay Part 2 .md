Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Write at least 250 words.
P1:The population in most parts of the world is ageing; people are living longer and there are fewer young people in many places as birth rates fall. This phenomenon has pros and cons, but this essay will contend that, on balance, the advantages of having an older population outweigh the negatives.

P2:The first issue that occurs to many people when considering the ageing population is the expense. If people live longer, they may have more than 30 years of retirement and may need to be supported financially by the government or their families. If they experience age-related illness, this impacts the health system and takes up resources needed by other people in society. What's more, when older people are financially independent, it might be hard for younger people if they have to compete to get a foot in the door of the housing market or gain employment.

P3:That being said, older people have a lot to contribute in terms of wisdom, experience and skills.Many people are active and productive for longer than their counterparts were 50 years ago and are an asset to the economy and society well into their old age. They are able to work for longer and after retirement they contribute in many ways too, such as by doing charitable work, spending money as consumers and supporting their families. Grandparents often care for their young grandchildren, making it easier for both parents to work.

P4:While it is ture that an ageing population poses challenges for governments, it is clear that these are outweighed by the significant benefits that elderly people bring to society.


（2）Some children spend hours every day on their smartphones. Why is this the case? Do you think this is a positive or a negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Write at least 250 words.

P1: obile phones nowadays contain essential features and also entertainment. There has been a large growth seen in the usage of smartphones among youngsters. There are several reasons behind this situation and I find this development more beneficial than negative. Both the reasons and my view is elaborated further.

P2: The first reason for the overuse of smart devices by youngsters are the social benefits they provide. A smart phone connected to the internet opens up large possibilities, from creating new friends to communicating with them over social media. For instance, a child in my neighbourhood chats for hours with his school friends on Facebook and also spends time on video sharing applications. Moreover, mobile gaming, especially multiplayer games, is another major reason for this situation. Children play different kinds of games on mobile for the entertainment purposes, and they involve themselves in games in such a manner that they forget about the time and other responsibilities.

P3: However, I believe that smartphones have also increased the knowledge of pupils. They have developed some important social skills, such as communication, team work and many more, by allowing them to work and play in groups, without the restriction of distance. In addition, children can learn through the internet by watching online videos and reading articles, which ultimately helps them in their studies as well as language skills. For example, whenever my niece requires to know something, she searches it online and finds out. Moreover, multiplayer online gaming improves their multitasking ability and it also gives them a competitive environment.

P4: Overall, I agree that the overuse of smartphones on a regular basis is harmful for children, but if given proper guidance, mobile phones can also help them in learning some life-long skills.
