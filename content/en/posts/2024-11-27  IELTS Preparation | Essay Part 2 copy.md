(1)To what extent do the advantages of having an ageing population outweigh the disadvantages?
Write about the following topic:
In many countries, people are now living longer than ever before. Somepeople say an ageing population creates problems for governments. Other people think there are benefits if society has more elderly people.To what extent do the advantages of having an ageing population outweigh the disadvantages?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Write at least 250 words.

P1:The population in most parts of the world is ageing; people are living longer and there are fewer young people in many places as birth rates fall. This phenomenon has pros and cons, but this essay will contend that, on balance, the advantages of having an older population outweigh the negatives.
开始： 世界大部分地区的人口都在老龄化；随着出生率的下降，人们的寿命越来越长，许多地方的年轻人越来越少。这一现象有利有弊，但本文认为，总的来说，人口老龄化利大于弊。

P2:The first issue that occurs to many people when considering the ageing population is the expense. If people live longer, they may have more than 30 years of retirement and may need to be supported financially by the government or their families. If they experience age-related illness, this impacts the health system and takes up resources needed by other people in society. What's more, when older people are financially independent, it might be hard for younger people if they have to compete to get a foot in the door of the housing market or gain employment.
(阐述对方观点)许多人在考虑人口老龄化问题时，首先想到的是费用问题。如果人的寿命延长，他们的退休年龄可能超过 30 年，可能需要政府或其家人在经济上给予支持。如果他们患上老年病，就会影响医疗系统，占用社会上其他人所需的资源。更重要的是，当老年人经济独立后，如果年轻人要竞争进入住房市场或就业，可能会很困难。

P3:That being said, older people have a lot to contribute in terms of wisdom, experience and skills.Many people are active and productive for longer than their counterparts were 50 years ago and are an asset to the economy and society well into their old age. They are able to work for longer and after retirement they contribute in many ways too, such as by doing charitable work, spending money as consumers and supporting their families. Grandparents often care for their young grandchildren, making it easier for both parents to work.
（让步，给出自己的观点）尽管如此，老年人在智慧、经验和技能方面仍可做出很多贡献。许多人比 50 年前的同龄人更有活力、更有生产力，他们在进入老年后仍是经济和社会的宝贵财富。他们的工作时间更长，退休后还能在许多方面做出贡献，如从事慈善工作、消费和养家糊口。祖父母经常照顾年幼的孙辈，使父母双方都能更轻松地工作。

P4:While it is ture that an ageing population poses challenges for governments, it is clear that these are outweighed by the significant benefits that elderly people bring to society.
结论： 人口老龄化确实给政府带来了挑战，但老年人给社会带来的巨大好处显然超过了这些挑战。

（2）Some children spend hours every day on their smartphones. Why is this the case? Do you think this is a positive or a negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Write at least 250 words.

Mobile phones nowadays contain essential features and also entertainment. There has been a large growth seen in the usage of smartphones among youngsters. There are several reasons behind this situation and I find this development more beneficial than negative. Both the reasons and my view is elaborated further.

如今的手机不仅具有基本功能，还具有娱乐功能。智能手机在年轻人中的使用率大幅增长。这种情况背后有几个原因，我认为这种发展利大于弊。下面将进一步阐述原因和我的观点。

The first reason for the overuse of smart devices by youngsters are the social benefits they provide. A smart phone connected to the internet opens up large possibilities, from creating new friends to communicating with them over social media. For instance, a child in my neighbourhood chats for hours with his school friends on Facebook and also spends time on video sharing applications. Moreover, mobile gaming, especially multiplayer games, is another major reason for this situation. Children play different kinds of games on mobile for the entertainment purposes, and they involve themselves in games in such a manner that they forget about the time and other responsibilities.
青少年过度使用智能设备的第一个原因是它们带来的社会效益。一部连接互联网的智能手机带来了巨大的可能性，从创建新朋友到通过社交媒体与他们交流。例如，我邻居家的一个孩子在 Facebook 上与他的同学朋友聊了几个小时，还花时间使用视频共享应用程序。此外，手机游戏，尤其是多人游戏，是造成这种情况的另一个主要原因。孩子们在手机上玩各种游戏，以娱乐为目的，他们沉浸在游戏中，忘记了时间和其他责任。

However, I believe that smartphones have also increased the knowledge of pupils. They have developed some important social skills, such as communication, team work and many more, by allowing them to work and play in groups, without the restriction of distance. In addition, children can learn through the internet by watching online videos and reading articles, which ultimately helps them in their studies as well as language skills. For example, whenever my niece requires to know something, she searches it online and finds out. Moreover, multiplayer online gaming improves their multitasking ability and it also gives them a competitive environment.
不过，我认为智能手机也增加了学生的知识。他们可以不受距离的限制，在小组中工作和玩耍，从而培养了一些重要的社交技能，如沟通、团队合作等。此外，孩子们还可以通过互联网观看在线视频和阅读文章来学习，这最终有助于他们的学习和语言技能。例如，每当我的外甥女需要了解一些知识时，她就会上网搜索并找到答案。此外，多人在线游戏提高了他们的多任务处理能力，也给了他们一个竞争的环境。

Overall, I agree that the overuse of smartphones on a regular basis is harmful for children, but if given proper guidance, mobile phones can also help them in learning some life-long skills.
总之，我同意经常过度使用智能手机对儿童有害，但如果给予适当的指导，手机也能帮助他们学习一些终身受益的知识。

[personal writing]
The widespread issue of children spending hours on smart devices every day has raised significant concerns. This essay examines the reasons behind this problem, outlines my pessimistic view of its impact, and calls for greater attention to address this alarming trend.

Several reasons explain why excessive screen time is so common among young children. Firstly, with the algorithm and artificial technology's development, smartphones are filled with numerous attractive institution, like games, social media, live living application and so on. In this case, If even adults struggle to resist these temptations, it is no surprise that young children, with their weaker self-control, are even more susceptible. Moreover, parents are the purchasers or providers of children’s cell phones. However, busy schedule may cause lack of supervision so that some children may feel relaxed and indifferent, even though they may realize it’s harmful to  devoting too much time to it. This means these children may get worse, paying more and more attention on screen time later or sooner. Therefore, the three parts combining, make it become a case. 

For my part, I hold the view that it represents a negative tendency, based on the above reasons	, thus it would hurt both the children's future and their body.  The first drawback is that excessive smartphone use reduces the time available for studying and developing other hobbies, which are essential for becoming a well-rounded individual. Children who spend hours on their phones are less likely to explore their potential skills and interests, which could affect their future career or academic prospects. Furthermore, overuse of smartphones can lead to health problems such as myopia and obesity due to physical inactivity and poor posture.  Taking the instance of my cousin Julia, a typical young child in China, who once spent hours every day shopping online, scrolling through social media, and playing video games. As a result, she gradually became disconnected from her studies and eventually gave up on her education over the past three years. Her health also suffered, once a slim and energetic girl, she now has poor eyesight and has gained significant weight. This shift in her lifestyle shows just how harmful excessive screen time can be for young children, especially when they are at such an impressionable age.

In conclusion, I think spending time on their smartphones every day is the result of three factors, including the seductive power of smart devices, students' low self-discipline, and inadequate parental monitoring. Based on these factors, I believe this trend poses significant risks to their development and well-being, and more attention is needed to address this issue.
