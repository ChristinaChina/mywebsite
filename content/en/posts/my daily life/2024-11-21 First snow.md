Yesterday I saw the first snowfall of the year, and this morning it seemed to materialize as  “sunrise in the east and snow in the west”. I was reminded of the original poem, “The west is veiled in the rain, the east enjoys sunshine.My gallant is as deep in love as the day is fine. （东边日出西边雨，道是无情却有情”）” It’s from a poem called “Two Songs of the Bamboo Branch（《竹枝词二首》）” by Liu Yuxi, who was a poet during the Tang Dynasty. The poem says that while the sun is rising in the east, it is raining in the west. It also says that the sky is not clear but there is clear sunshine. The poem talks about the weather, but the author uses a clever pun, “sunny - love,” to write about both weather and love. The sun is shining in the east and raining in the west, so I thought he was heartless, but he still has love.
Kind of like my current situation and state of mind.

Actually, the “sun snow” phenomenon is pretty straightforward. It happens when cold and warm air masses converge locally. When the cold air hits the warm air underneath, the dry cold air and warm moist air meet and form snowfall. At the same time, the clouds at the top aren't thick enough to block the sun completely. There might be some sunlight coming through the gaps in the clouds, which will make it look like there's sunshine and snow on the ground at the same time. Since there aren't many clouds, “solar snow” doesn’t stick around for long. It usually happens in the 9-10 or 15-16 hour window. You don't need fancy weather to get a short burst of snow. It's more about enjoying the view than anything else.

Kind of like my current situation and state of mind. Attached is the ending of the sky taken yesterday
