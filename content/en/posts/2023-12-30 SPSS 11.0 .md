In descriptive statistics, the mean (also called the average) is one of the most fundamental measures used to represent the central tendency of a dataset. It is often used to summarize a set of values with a single number that best represents the entire distribution of data.
# Definition
The mean is calculated by summing all the values in a dataset and then dividing by the number of values. It is commonly used to understand the overall level of a dataset, such as the average score of students in a class, the average income in a region, or the average temperature of a month.
# Formula
For a sample of size nn with values x1,x2,...,xnx1​,x2​,...,xn​, the sample mean is calculated as:
Mean=x1+x2+⋯+xnnMean=nx1​+x2​+⋯+xn​​
Where:x1,x2,...,xnx1​,x2​,...,xn​ are the individual data points; nn is the total number of data points.
For a population, the formula is very similar, but we use NN to denote the total number of individuals in the population, and it is often denoted as the population mean:
Population Mean=X1+X2+⋯+XNNPopulation Mean=NX1​+X2​+⋯+XN​​
Where:
X1,X2,...,XNX1​,X2​,...,XN​ are the individual data points in the population.
NN is the total number of data points in the population.
Example:
If we have the following data representing the test scores of 5 students:
85,90,95,80,8885,90,95,80,88
The mean test score is calculated as:
Mean=85+90+95+80+885=4385=87.6Mean=585+90+95+80+88​=5438​=87.6
Thus, the average score is 87.6.

# Key Points
1. The mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers). A very high or very low value can significantly alter the mean.
2. It is best used when the data is symmetrically distributed without significant outliers.
3. In cases with outliers or skewed data, the median or mode might be more appropriate measures of central tendency.
