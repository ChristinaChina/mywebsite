While sorting out my memories, I found out that the Boston Museum of Fine Arts has a description of the paintings, so I'm going to put some records of the paintings on the website and post a link to them. If you are interested in this content, you can click <a href='https://collections.mfa.org/advancedsearch;jsessionid=7789F17F27257FC632ACCAEA86A506B0/' target="_blank">'here'</a > to go to the official website of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. This will also make it easier for me to recall later.
