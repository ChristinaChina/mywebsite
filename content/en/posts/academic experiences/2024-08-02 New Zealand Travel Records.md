I can already see that I'm going to miss the short half month I spent in New Zealand for the next six months. It all seems to have started back in February when I felt lost in life. I wanted to go into academia, but had almost no substantial work to show for it. So I decided to apply to the IAMCR and if that didn't work out I would look for an internship. Luckily, my application was successful, which gave me a huge boost for what came next. Looking back, even if it hadn't worked out, I would have kept going. I hope to have more time to visit New Zealand again in the future, perhaps next spring, summer or autumn! I'd love to share the details of my trip with you, but for now I'm keeping the details of hotels, restaurants and activities to myself. If you're interested, feel free to drop me a line and I'll share them individually.

1. June 29 – Beijing → Auckland → Christchurch 
After a long flight, I finally arrived in Auckland. Although it was just a transit stop, it gave me a taste of New Zealand’s atmosphere. After another flight, I reached Christchurch. The jet lag left me a little tired, but it didn’t take away my excitement for the journey ahead.

2. June 30 – Christchurch City Tour + Gathering + Opening Ceremony 
On my first day in Christchurch, I joined a city tour and explored the unique charm of this city. Christchurch blends modernity and tradition beautifully. Walking through the streets, I marveled at the cityscape and enjoyed meeting people from around the world. In the evening, I attended the opening ceremony with teachers and students from the academic community. The lively atmosphere made me realize how much I truly enjoyed being there.

3. July 1 – Kaikoura Whale Watching + Seals 
Kaikoura has always been on my bucket list for whale watching. The sea breeze and the excitement on the boat made my heart race. Whales leaped out of the water, their massive bodies leaving me in awe. Later, we spotted seals basking lazily in the sun, seeming to enjoy the peace of the sea.

4. July 2 – Conference, Attending Lectures 
This was a busy day filled with academic events. Although the day was hectic, it was also enriching. I had the chance to learn about the latest research and connect with colleagues, discussing many fascinating topics.

5. July 3 – Lake Tekapo + Mount John + Tekapo Hot Springs 
Leaving the bustle of the city behind, I ventured to Lake Tekapo. The water was a stunning shade of blue, and the snow-capped mountains reflected on the lake, creating a picturesque view. We climbed Mount John for panoramic views of the entire area. After the day’s adventures, I relaxed in the Tekapo Hot Springs, letting the warm water soothe my body. One of the day’s highlights was the salmon pie recommended by our guide. The crispy crust combined with the rich, fresh salmon made it a delicious surprise!

6. July 4 – Exhibition + Botanic Gardens + Antarctic Centre 
Christchurch’s Botanic Gardens were a joy to wander through, with the colorful flowers and fragrant scents captivating me. At the Antarctic Centre, I experienced a simulation of an Antarctic expedition, giving me a glimpse of the icy world and its unique beauty.

7. July 4 Evening – Christchurch → Queenstown 
In the evening, I flew to Queenstown, a town known for its extreme sports and breathtaking scenery, marking another highlight of my trip.

8. July 5 – Exhibition + Shopping + Gondola Ride 
I was pleasantly surprised by the exhibitions and the charming shops in Queenstown. Later, we took the gondola up to the mountain, offering stunning views of the town, which felt like a little piece of paradise.

9. July 6 – Cruise → Fjords 
This day was especially sunny and bright. While we didn’t see the fjords due to some circumstances, the boat ride itself was still delightful. The sea breeze and the laughter of fellow travelers made the experience enjoyable. Even though I didn’t get to witness the grand fjord views, the peaceful moments on the water were fulfilling.

10. July 7 – Cruise + Alpacas 
The cruise continued, and we also visited an alpaca farm. Watching these fluffy creatures roam around was a heartwarming experience, and it certainly brought a lightness to my mood.

11. July 8 – Arrowtown 
This day, I visited Arrowtown on my own. The tranquility and beauty of the town made me slow down and savor the atmosphere. While wandering, I stumbled into an independent design studio. The door read “Closed Today,” but fate had something else in store—I ran into the designer! She was incredibly welcoming and shared her creative journey with me, talking about how she turned her ideas into unique works of art. We exchanged thoughts on our backgrounds and interests, and despite the language barrier, our shared curiosity and warmth made our conversation deeply meaningful. This unexpected encounter became the most special gift Arrowtown had to offer.

12. July 9 – Queenstown → Tekapo → Mount Cook Hike → Stargazing
The day was packed with activities. We left Queenstown for Tekapo, where we immediately set off for a hike on Mount Cook. It was both a physical challenge and an opportunity to connect with nature. The highlight of the day came at night when I stood under the vast, starlit sky in Tekapo. The experience of looking up at the stars felt like merging with the universe.

13. July 10 – Tekapo → Auckland + Exhibition
I departed from Tekapo and headed to Auckland. Even as the journey neared its end, I remained excited to explore new things. The exhibitions in Auckland once again impressed me with their creativity and vibrancy.

14. July 11 – Auckland Museum + Gathering 
I visited the Auckland Museum today to learn more about New Zealand's history and culture. In the evening, I had the opportunity to connect with new friends at a gathering, exchanging travel stories and enjoying a pleasant evening together.

15. July 12 – Eden Park + Shopping 
Eden Park, one of Auckland's iconic spots, offered breathtaking views of the city. Afterward, I spent some time shopping, picking up souvenirs to remember the trip.

16. July 13 – Shopping + Flight to Beijing 
On my last day, I relaxed and shopped for some final souvenirs. In the evening, with a heart full of memories and a bit of sadness, I boarded the flight back to Beijing.

17. Reflection on Personal Growth and Challenges 
While I initially came to New Zealand alone, I found myself stepping into the role of organizer and communicator during the trip. In the beginning, managing the itinerary and coordinating everyone's schedules felt overwhelming, especially when things didn’t go as planned. At times, I doubted my ability to handle everything, but over time, I grew into the role. My sister, with whom I collaborated during the trip, said to me, "You’re tougher than you think. Don’t be anxious. Even though I know it’s difficult for someone your age, remember you’re incredible, and the rest will fall into place with time." 
This moment of encouragement reminded me that while self-doubt is natural, surrounding myself with supportive and understanding people can help me grow and push through challenges. This journey was not just about exploring a beautiful country but also about discovering my strength and resilience.
