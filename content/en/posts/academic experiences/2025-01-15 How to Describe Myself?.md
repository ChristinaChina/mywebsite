I'm not perfect or even flawed, but still moving forward with gusto.

ICA came out with results and I submitted a writing sample for this year. That means I'll be travelling to Denver this summer for an oral presentation. To my delight, several of the review suggestions were very well reasoned. It's not the work I'm most happy with, and there are even a lot of parts that I know how to revise but haven't had time to tweak yet. But I think it's a work that shows more of my thoughts, feelings and initial attempts at theorising in the middle of my masters, or it externalises my personality in a way. So I was willing to take a risk, to submit it to a conference, and even to use it as a sample of my writing. I don't want to be packaged, I want to validate what kind of relationship I have with certain things at a certain stage. If I can write a perfect piece of work at this stage, then why do I need to apply for a PhD and study again systematically? I could just become an independent researcher. However, I'd better not let it be an excuse for me to slack off either, haha! Go for it, and keep up the good work!
