# Definition of "Quantitative"
"Quantitative" refers to an attribute that exists in numerical form and can be measured.
The purpose of quantitative research is to discover general behavioral patterns and provide universal explanations for phenomena in various environments. It is typically conducted to derive statistical results for a specific research population.

Common Types of Quantitative Data:
1. Height
2. Weight
3. Age
4. Income

# Research Process Flowchart
## Define Research Objectives
1. Clearly state the aim of the research.
2. Identify key questions and expected outcomes.
# Conceptualization
1. Develop a theoretical framework.
2. Define key concepts and relationships.
# Select Research Methods
1. Choose qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods.
2. Determine data collection techniques.
# Observation
1. Gather data through fieldwork, surveys, or experiments.
2. Ensure reliability and validity.
# Population & Sampling
1. Define the target population.
2. Select sampling methods and size.
# Operationalization
1. Convert concepts into measurable variables.
2. Develop instruments like questionnaires or coding schemes.
# Data Processing
1. Clean, organize, and prepare data for analysis.
2. Handle missing or inconsistent data.
# Analysis
1. Apply statistical or qualitative analysis techniques.
2. Interpret findings and draw conclusions.
# Application & Review
1. Apply results to real-world scenarios or theoretical discussions.
2. Reflect on the research process and suggest improvements.

# Quantitative Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis refers to the application of statistical methods to analyze collected data quantitatively. This approach reveals the internal numerical relationships, patterns, and developments within the data.

Main Functions of Statistical Analysis:
1. Provides a clear and precise formal language for research.
2. Simplifies and describes data.

Example:
Qualitative Analysis:When studying people's behavior before the implementation of the one-child policy, it can be observed that fertility behavior is influenced by educational level. In general, women with higher education tend to have fewer children than those with lower education. Qualitative analysis can only provide this general understanding.
Quantitative Analysis:Using a quantitative approach, this relationship can be formulated as a mathematical equation: Y = 3.25 - 0.12X (Where:Y represents the number of children a woman has. X represents the level of education.) From this equation, it is evident that for every increase in education level, the expected number of children decreases by 0.12.
