This film represents the culmination of the Documentary Theory and Practice final assignment, which my group and I completed in June 2021. The group included Xiaoqing Lin, Xinyan Hu, and Yuting Zhou.

This documentary is all about showcasing the genuine, authentic ecosystem of Beixiazhu, which is known as the “No. 1 Village of Live Streaming Influencers.”
The title “Southbound and Northbound” has a double meaning. On the one hand, it shows how lots of streamers are coming from all over the country, hoping to make it big in the live streaming economy. On the other hand, it suggests that this place has trouble keeping people around for long. Many people try it for a while and then move on, becoming just passing through. This kind of transience isn’t just a feature of Beixiazhu; it’s also a reflection of the fast-changing dynamics behind the live streaming economy. Beixiazhu is located in Yiwu, Zhejiang Province, and it's known as the “No. 1 Village of Live Streaming Influencers.” Streamers, suppliers, and entrepreneurs from all over the country come together here to form a complex yet highly efficient commercial ecosystem, using the internet to promote products across the country and even globally. But there are some big challenges lurking beneath the surface. These include intense competition in the industry, the unpredictability of traffic platforms, and the high turnover of participants. This place is both a stage for dreams and a destination where dreams are shattered, which makes it an especially compelling subject for us to explore.

It's worth mentioning that this documentary was filmed in June 2021, when there were still strict restrictions in place due to the pandemic. We didn’t originally plan to focus on this topic, and because of time constraints, the final product might not fully meet our ideal vision. However, we gave it our all during our creative peak. Starting in April 2021, my team and I reached out to over a dozen topics that seemed promising. We did on-site research in cities like Hangzhou and Zhaoqing. We also visited at least three locations in Nanchang. But due to various limitations, we had to keep changing our plans.

As the deadline for submission drew near and our equipment rental period extended to over two weeks without much progress, we started to feel the pressure. But after a lot of twists and turns, we finally came across the story of Beixiazhu and decided to dig deeper into the facade and reality of the “No. 1 Village of Live Streaming Influencers.”

We’re really grateful to have encountered this topic, and even more so for the perseverance and dedication of our team, which allowed us to bring this documentary to completion.
