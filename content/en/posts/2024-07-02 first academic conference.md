At the end of March, I was thrilled to discover the incredible opportunity to submit my first academic training paper to IAMCR! I was thrilled to give it a try! I was thrilled to receive an acceptance notification just a few weeks later! I'm thrilled to say that my first academic paper was accepted by an international conference, which marks the start of my journey into formal academic presentations!  

I was so excited to attend the conference that I booked a flight on June 29th! I departed from Beijing and flew to Auckland, New Zealand, where I transferred to Christchurch. This journey was a thrilling adventure, marking my first international academic trip and the start of an amazing journey! Late June to early July is winter in New Zealand, and the crisp air and vivid blue skies were refreshing. Christchurch, with its classical and elegant architecture, tidy streets, and serene atmosphere, exuded a natural purity that felt completely different from the Northern Hemisphere. I was secretly hoping that if all went well, I might return here in the future, participating in academic activities with more composure and confidence.  

Amidst the absolutely gorgeous scenery, I felt completely at ease. On the day of my presentation, I was brimming with excitement as I stood on the escalator heading to the presentation floor. I checked the group's schedule and was thrilled to see that two members of the review panel held the title of "Professor," while another participant came from a globally renowned university. This impressive lineup made me feel excited—not because I feared authority itself—but because I was eager to show these experienced researchers that I was ready to contribute to the discussion. I was excited to share my analysis, confident that my methods were appropriate, and eager to deliver my findings in an effective way.

Sensing my unease, a doctoral student from Beijing University traveling with me gave me a gentle pat on the shoulder and offered encouragement. "It's okay! Think about it—those panelists already have high external recognition, but the fact that you, at such a young age, can stand on the same stage as them also proves your capability! "Since the reviewers accepted your paper, you should confidently present your work." Her words were a revelation, offering me immense comfort. She was absolutely right! If I lacked confidence in myself, how could I possibly expect others to take an interest in my research?  

When it was finally my turn to present, I took a deep breath, adjusted my breathing to calm myself, and began my first formal academic presentation. I was so excited to share my work with everyone! With a clear and steady voice, I started with a smile on my face. *"Dear distinguished chair and panelists…"The moment I spoke, I was flooded with a growing sense of composure and confidence, and my words flowed more smoothly than I could have imagined! It was incredible! All my preparation had converged into a force at that moment, and I realized I was more capable than I had ever imagined! I was thrilled to present the background, methodology, findings, and significance of my research, even taking note of the panelists' reactions. Their encouraging smiles gave me a huge boost in confidence!  

After my presentation, the panelists gave me some amazing feedback and really valuable suggestions. This was a huge boost for my confidence in my research, and it also made me appreciate even more the true joy of academic exploration: continuous learning and progress! I realized that in academia, there's no such thing as being completely "ready"—and that's a good thing! The key is taking that first step and then finding better directions as you move forward!  

My IAMCR experience was incredible! Not only did I gain academic refinement, but I also gained the courage and confidence to grow. This experience taught me an important lesson: you don't have to be perfect at the beginning! It is by taking the first step and moving forward through trial and error that we grow and learn and become the best we can be! It doesn't matter if you're just starting out or if the journey is a little rocky. What matters is not letting fear hold you back. Instead, find your rhythm through exploration and enjoy the ride!  

And let me tell you, New Zealand's stunning landscapes have become an absolutely cherished part of my memories! Christchurch in winter is absolutely breathtaking! The pristine, serene beauty left me completely enchanted. I'm absolutely certain I'll be back in this incredible land one day, brimming with even more courage and conviction to continue my academic journey.  

This academic presentation taught me an invaluable lesson: don't wait until everything is perfectly prepared before taking action! Growth happens through action—and it's an amazing thing to behold! This experience was the start of something great! It planted the seeds for my future journey and strengthened my resolve to continue on the academic path. It was an absolutely unforgettable experience that I will always treasure!
