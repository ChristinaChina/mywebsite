## Research Interests
I am interested in cultural studies, particularly in the interplay between technology and culture. My recent work focuses on the critical analysis of digital media culture and digital activism. Methodologically, I am primarily trained in qualitative research, employing semi-structured depth interview and analyzing empirical materials through thematic analysis informed by grounded theory. Other ongoing interests include digital journalism, gender studies and comparative-historical methods.

## Publication 
Huang, W., He, Z., Zhao, Q., & Chang, J., Public Trust and Community Develpment: A Review of Communication Research in 2023, Press, 2024, (01), 32-48. 【Chinese Social Sciences Citation Index】\
This article uses the LDA topic model to conduct a comprehensive and detailed review of global communication research in 2023 and summarizes the core issues and evolving patterns of the current theoretical development of communication studies. Through topic clustering and text mining of 2210 academic papers, this article distills six major sections and 19 themes of journalism research this year and analyzes representative literature under different themes. This article finds three core characteristics of global communication research in 2023: exploring how public trust is reaffirmed and reconstructed in the digital media ecosystem; interpreting the close relationship between digital media technology and the development of different types of communities; concerning people's physical and mental health and spiritual well-being in the digital information environment. This article believes that in an era of highly integrated concepts and experiences, overly refined typological systems and sectoral consciousness have become obstacles to theoretical growth. Communication academia must make changes to the sociology-political science binary that dominates its development to realize real growth.

## peer-reviewed conference presentations
1. He, Z. 2024. Aesthetics as an Invisible Power: A Chronological Examination Based on Youth’ s Cultural Consumption of Celebrities. Paper Presented at the 107th Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication(AEJMC), Philadelphia, America. \
As one of the most prevalent symbols in media culture, celebrity has an equally important influence on the aesthetic culture of society at large. Based on this, this study conducted in-depth interviews with 27 individuals from different generations, aiming to reveal the changes in the consumption of celebrity symbols by Chinese youth, and to explore the role of aesthetic power in this field. It is found that the changes in individuals’ aesthetic experiences not only reflect the ideologies and social disciplines of different eras, but also the process of consumers adjusting their aesthetics for greater exchange value. This paper asserts that the process of celebrity consumption is an intertwining of aesthetic change and fantasy overflow in reality, reflecting the complex aesthetic mechanisms and cultural dynamics in consumer society.

2. He, Z. 2024. Relational Practices of Digital Mourning Through the Lens of Continuing Bonds. Paper Presented at the 107th Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication(AEJMC), Philadelphia, America. \
This study explores the changes in the object, time, and space of digital mourning relative to traditional mourning, as well as the role of technology and its impact on socio-emotional connections. Through semi-structured in-depth interviews with 35 individuals who honored non-family members and friends on social media, the study found that the object of digital mourning extends to non-family members, that mourning is not strictly limited in time, and can be instantaneous or continuous; and that spatially it occurs in virtual space, breaking down physical spatial constraints. The spread of technology, the expansion of social networks, and the convenience of social media are the main drivers.

3. He, Z. 2024. Research on the Female Images in Hou Hsiao-hsien’ s Films. Paper Presented at the 2024 International Association for Media and Communication Research(IAMCR), Christchurch, New Zealand.\
This paper employs textual analysis as the primary research method, examining the portrayal of women in the 19 films directed by Hou Hsiao-hsien and categorizing it into two distinct groups: women within the family and women in society. It then proceeds to interpret and refine these portrayals through the use of comparison and analogical analysis, as well as dialectical thinking to elucidate the differences and similarities in the representation of female images and the characterization under the mapping of female images.

## Undereviewed Paper
1. He, Z. The Work Ethic of Chinese Digital Feminists: From the Neoliberalism Perspective\
In this essay, I employ online ethnographic study and in-depth interviews with 35 Chinese digital feminists to illustrate how digital feminists in China respondto neoliberal conditions and how they sustain their activism despite a lack of unanimous support within their own groups. My analysis indicates that digital feminists in China have employed public interest activities as a cultural instrument tochallenge the advancement of global neoliberalism. Consequently, they have progressively investigated the formulation of a feminist cultural politics that is alignedwith the political and commercial contexts of China.

2. He, Z. Finding Positive Elements in a Negative Ecology: Based on Field Observations of Gender NGOs in China\
This paper employs a mixed-methods approach, integrating data from two sources: participatory observation of two gender NGOs in X City from April to October 2024 and global feminist oral interviews. This integration allows for a comprehensive examination of the existential landscape of contemporary gender NGOs in China. The analysis is grounded in a continuous and three-dimensional view of contemporary feminist history in China.

3. He, Z. Affective Mechanisms in Digital Journalism: What is Possible and What is Doable\
This paper examines the characteristics of different disciplines to review the literature on “digital journalism”, “emotion/affect” and “emotional/affective research in digital journalism”. It highlights the importance of emotional mechanisms in digital journalism from both theoretical and epistemological perspectives. Building on this foundation, the paper analyzes and summarizes existing research on emotional mechanisms within the global academic community, focusing on the levels of journalism production, distribution, and reception.
