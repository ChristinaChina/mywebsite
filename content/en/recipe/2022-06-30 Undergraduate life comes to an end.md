"All theory is gray, but the golden tree of life springs ever green." I originally intended to borrow this line from Faust, feigning a sense of depth to mark the end of these four years. Yet at this moment, what floods my mind is not a series of adjectives but vivid memories of events and specific people.

My parents, who have stood unwaveringly behind me since the day I was born, have been my greatest support. My advisor Yuhua PENG, whose thoughtful guidance helped me realize my passion for theory far outweighs my interest in industry work, gave my life plan a new direction. And all the friends I have met along the way. Together, we ran through campuses and cities, dedicating ourselves to public service. We insisted on pursuing in-depth reporting and even founded our own magazine. We spent countless hours practicing in the taekwondo gym and the dance studio, and we honed our communication skills through student leadership roles. These experiences enriched my college years beyond measure and helped me discover a part of myself, someone who cherishes solitude more than ever before.

Of course, I cannot overlook the fact that the pandemicâ€™s restrictions consumed much of my college life. The suffocating feeling of daily life being tightly constrained left an indelible mark, and I am not sure when, or if, this weight will fully lift. I have come to embrace the idea of letting the winds of the times carry me wherever they will and planting roots wherever I land. When necessary, I believe in being bold and even angry. That way, when I revisit this journey one day, I can find comfort in knowing I dared to respond to the challenges and uncertainties of my era.

I am deeply grateful for every encounter and every connection. These rich experiences have shaped me, making my journey through these years profoundly meaningful and uniquely my own.
