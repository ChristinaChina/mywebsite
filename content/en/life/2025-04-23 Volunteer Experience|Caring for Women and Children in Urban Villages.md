What makes Shenzhen truly special to me is the warmth and resilience of its people. This spirit inspired me to become part of the Green Rose Volunteer Community, where we work to uplift women and children in urban villages. Every Friday night, I host film screenings for local kids, sharing stories that spark curiosity and encourage growth. Watching the community evolve week by week, I see Shenzhen’s legacy come alive through the small, sustainable changes we create together.
