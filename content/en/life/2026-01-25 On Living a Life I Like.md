For a long time, I kept asking myself what kind of life I want, and what would count as a life that feels “good enough” to me.
Maybe it is not some predefined template of success.
Maybe it is not a life built on constant praise or continuous affirmation.
For me, at least at this moment, as I am typing these words, the life I am living now is a life I like.
It is made up of things that are very concrete, yet easy to overlook.
For example, I can sleep with a sense of calm.
When I wake up, I still feel willing to eat.
I have a few things in my hands that are moving forward steadily. They are not urgent, but they are moving.
I have a family who is healthy, who loves me, who tries to understand me, and who offers me strong support.
I also have friends who share my wavelength, people I can sit in silence with, or talk nonsense with.
I have some hobbies, and some things I know I am reasonably good at.
All of this sounds ordinary.
But the older I get, the more I feel how rare it actually is.
Because what truly wears us down in life is often not a single failure, but long stretches of unease, disorder, and that feeling of having everything around you while being unable to hold onto anything.
I think it is a good feeling to be supported by these specific, tangible things.
The rhythm of the body, the warmth of relationships, everyday interests, these are, in themselves, a form of luck.
Maybe this is not a life that looks dramatic or spectacular.
But it is a life that can be continued.
To certain versions of myself between the ages of twenty and thirty, I want to say this.
If you are in a phase that feels uncertain right now, I hope you can still sleep, still eat, and still be gently held by yourself, by a few people, and by a few things.
That alone is already something worth cherishing.
