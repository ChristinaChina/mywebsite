During the academic lecture, four research methods were introduced: classic ethnography, dialogical and biographical approaches, cultural semiotics, and neo-/post-Marxist approaches.
I have two related questions: 
First, these four methods may differ in their theoretical foundations and epistemologies. Is it truly feasible to integrate them in a single study? If so, what theoretical or methodological considerations should be taken into account to ensure a coherent integration? 
Second, at the operational level, how can researchers minimize the disparity between their own social position and that of the research participants? As researchers, we inevitably form certain value judgments from reading extensive literature and background materials before entering the field. How, then, can one avoid adopting an “arrogant” stance toward participants? What strategies or practices can help maintain sensitivity and respect, ensuring that the research process is conducted in an ethical and equitable manner?
