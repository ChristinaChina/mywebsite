In recent years, the popularity of following fashion trends has increased significantly, shaping various aspects of daily life. This essay examines the factors contributing to the strong influence of global fashion and contends that, overall, this development produces more negative than positive effects.

A primary factor behind the expanding influence of global fashion is the rapid advancement of social media. Technology companies employ algorithms to analyze user preferences and consistently promote fashion-related content on digital platforms. As a result, people are repeatedly exposed to global trends and may feel pressured to follow them. Another reason is peer influence. Fashion often becomes a common topic in social interactions, helping people connect with friends and avoid awkward conversations. Finally, economic factors also play an important role. To increase profits, fashion companies intensively market new trends, encouraging consumers to make more frequent purchases.

From my perspective, the disadvantages of this trend outweigh its benefits. Admittedly, global fashion can improve people’s aesthetic awareness and provide shared topics for social communication. However, excessive attention to fashion may have long-term negative effects on personal development and mental health. Spending too much time and energy on appearance can distract individuals from more meaningful pursuits, such as education, physical health, or family relationships. Moreover, constant comparison with others’ clothing and appearance can lead to self-doubt and reduced self-confidence, which may cause psychological stress.

In conclusion, the strong influence of global fashion is driven by social media, peer pressure, and commercial interests. Although it brings some short-term advantages, people should approach fashion trends critically and avoid allowing them to dominate their values and lifestyles.
