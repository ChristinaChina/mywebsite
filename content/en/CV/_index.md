## Research Interests
I am interested in cultural studies, particularly in the interplay between technology and culture. Methodologically, I am primarily trained in qualitative research, employing semi-structured depth interview and analyzing empirical materials through thematic analysis informed by grounded theory. 

Ongoing ongoing interests include the construction of technology, sociocultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology and comparative-historical methods.

## Personal Information
- Educational Background

   - I have received interdisciplinary training across journalism, communication studies, and cultural anthropology during my undergraduate and master’s studies. My academic education spans both China and Germany, combining a strong foundation in news production, media theory, and communication research with anthropological perspectives on culture, society, and everyday practices. This cross-disciplinary and cross-regional educational background has enabled me to approach media and cultural phenomena with both empirical sensitivity and critical, comparative insight.

## Peer-reviewed Conference Presentations
- He, Z. 2025. The Work Ethic of Chinese Digital Feminists: From the Neoliberalism Perspective. Paper Presented at the 75th Annual Conference of the International Communication Association(ICA), Colorado, USA.\
In this essay, I employ online ethnographic study and in-depth interviews with 35 Chinese digital feminists to illustrate how digital feminists in China respondto neoliberal conditions and how they sustain their activism despite a lack of unanimous support within their own groups. My analysis indicates that digital feminists in China have employed public interest activities as a cultural instrument tochallenge the advancement of global neoliberalism. Consequently, they have progressively investigated the formulation of a feminist cultural politics that is alignedwith the political and commercial contexts of China.

- He, Z. 2024. Aesthetics as an Invisible Power: A Chronological Examination Based on Youth’ s Cultural Consumption of Celebrities. Paper Presented at the 107th Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication(AEJMC), Philadelphia, America. \
As one of the most prevalent symbols in media culture, celebrity has an equally important influence on the aesthetic culture of society at large. Based on this, this study conducted in-depth interviews with 27 individuals from different generations, aiming to reveal the changes in the consumption of celebrity symbols by Chinese youth, and to explore the role of aesthetic power in this field. It is found that the changes in individuals’ aesthetic experiences not only reflect the ideologies and social disciplines of different eras, but also the process of consumers adjusting their aesthetics for greater exchange value. This paper asserts that the process of celebrity consumption is an intertwining of aesthetic change and fantasy overflow in reality, reflecting the complex aesthetic mechanisms and cultural dynamics in consumer society.

- He, Z. 2024. Relational Practices of Digital Mourning Through the Lens of Continuing Bonds. Paper Presented at the 107th Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication(AEJMC), Philadelphia, America. \
This study explores the changes in the object, time, and space of digital mourning relative to traditional mourning, as well as the role of technology and its impact on socio-emotional connections. Through semi-structured in-depth interviews with 35 individuals who honored non-family members and friends on social media, the study found that the object of digital mourning extends to non-family members, that mourning is not strictly limited in time, and can be instantaneous or continuous; and that spatially it occurs in virtual space, breaking down physical spatial constraints. The spread of technology, the expansion of social networks, and the convenience of social media are the main drivers.

- He, Z. 2024. Research on the Female Images in Hou Hsiao-hsien’ s Films. Paper Presented at the 2024 International Association for Media and Communication Research(IAMCR), Christchurch, New Zealand.\
This paper employs textual analysis as the primary research method, examining the portrayal of women in the 19 films directed by Hou Hsiao-hsien and categorizing it into two distinct groups: women within the family and women in society. It then proceeds to interpret and refine these portrayals through the use of comparison and analogical analysis, as well as dialectical thinking to elucidate the differences and similarities in the representation of female images and the characterization under the mapping of female images.
