Hi, I’m Zhenting. I am a master’s student in **Sociocultural Anthropology** at **University of Heidelberg** in Germany, from southeastern China. My research focuses on **critical media culture, migration, gender, and visual anthropology**, with particular attention to the **cultural and philosophical dimensions of digital media, highly skilled migration, and digital surveillance**. Methodologically, I use **fieldwork and semi-structured interviews**, combined with **textual and visual analysis**, to explore how everyday practices, identities, and social relations are shaped through culture and technology. My research sites include **East Asia, the United States, and Germany**.

I am systematically expanding my knowledge of **philosophy and social-cultural anthropology** and engaging with **cutting-edge theories** to better understand these contemporary issues.  

Outside of research, I enjoy **teaching, volunteering, working on documentaries and films, and engaging with diverse communities**, experiences that often inspire new perspectives for my academic work.
