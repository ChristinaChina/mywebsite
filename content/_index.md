One line I’ve long held close comes from Antonio Gramsci: “pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will.”

I study how media technologies shape everyday life and human relationships, with a focus on gendered experiences. My research explores digital media, digital journalism, visual culture, memory, and care, examining how people experience and make meaning in contemporary society. I approach these questions from media studies and cultural anthropology, with particular attention to China and transnational contexts.

I see academic work as an integral part of my life, so beyond reading and writing, I enjoy observing how society works. I also value time on my own, enjoying visits to museums, street photography, animation, hiking, and detective films, while appreciating time shared with my family.
