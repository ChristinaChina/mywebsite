I am a third-year master's student at Shenzhen University's School of Media and Communication, on track to complete my degree by summer 2025. From October 2024 to March 2025, I am also a visiting student in the Department of Social Sciences and Philosophy at Philipps University of Marburg, Germany, where I am furthering my research and studies.
