Hi, I’m Zhenting. One line I’ve long held close comes from Antonio Gramsci: “pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will.” I created this website to organize my academic research and practical experiences, and to showcase my research interests to fellow scholars

Currently, I am a master’s student in **Sociocultural Anthropology** at <a href='https://https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en' target="_blank">University of Heidelberg</a > in Germany, from southeastern China. My research focuses on critical media culture, migration, gender, and visual anthropology, with particular attention to the **cultural and philosophical dimensions of digital media, highly skilled migration, and digital surveillance**. Methodologically, I use **fieldwork and semi-structured interviews**, combined with **textual and visual analysis**, to explore how everyday practices, identities, and social relations are shaped through culture and technology. My research sites include **East Asia, the United States, and Germany**.  

For more details about my background, please feel free to check out my <a href='/files/CV-Zhenting HE.pdf'  target="_blank"> CV </a >tab. In terms of my academic experience, please refer to the <a href='https://www.zhentinghe.com/en/research/' target="_blank">'Research'</a > tab. To view personal posts that reflect my personality, please check the <a href='https://www.zhentinghe.com/en/life/' target="_blank">'Life'</a > tab.

I am systematically expanding my knowledge of **philosophy and social-cultural anthropology** and engaging with cutting-edge theories to better understand these contemporary issues.  

Outside of research, I enjoy *teaching, volunteering, working on documentaries and films, and engaging with diverse communities*, experiences that often inspire new perspectives for my academic work.
