{{<figure src="/images/homepage.jpg" title="Welcome to my homepage! My name is Zhenting HE." width="360">}}

I am currently in the first semester of my second master’s degree, studying Sociocultural Anthropology at <a href='https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en' target='blank'> Heidelberg University </a >,with a minor in Philosophy, and I hold a master’s degree in Media and Communication, advised by <a href='https://cmc.szu.edu.cn/info/1067/1069.htm' target="_blank"> Jiang CHANG</a >. One line I’ve always held close comes from Antonio Gramsci: “pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will.”
