One line I’ve long held close comes from Antonio Gramsci: “pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will.”

 I am interested in how media technologies shape everyday life and human relationships, with particular attention to gendered experiences. My work focuses on media, culture, and lived experience, especially in relation to digital media, visual culture, memory, and care in contemporary society. I draw on perspectives from media studies and cultural anthropology, with a focus on China and transnational contexts.

I see academic work as an integral part of my life, so beyond reading and writing, I enjoy observing how society works. I also value time on my own, enjoying visits to museums, street photography, animation, hiking, and detective films, while appreciating time shared with my family.
