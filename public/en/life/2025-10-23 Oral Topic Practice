# Concentration

## Did you stay focused in class when you were a child?
Initial Version: Not really. I still remember that when I was a kindergarten student, I often skipped class because I didn’t like it. When I was in the classroom, I usually felt nervous.
I didn’t really like listening to the teacher, so I often couldn’t focus during class.

Revised Version: Not really. I remember that when I was in kindergarten, I often found it difficult to stay in class because I felt uncomfortable and nervous in a formal classroom setting.
As a result, I was not very attentive to the teacher and often struggled to maintain concentration during lessons.

## Are you a focused person?
Initial Version: I’m not completely sure. Sometimes I think I can focus very well on one thing, for example when I’m doing a project or working on something related to my studies.
But at other times, I don’t think I’m very focused. For example, when my friends or classmates talk about things that I find boring, I don’t really pay attention to what they’re saying.

Revised Version: I would say my ability to focus is situational. When I am working on a task that is clearly structured, such as a project or academic assignment, I can usually concentrate quite well.
However, in less engaging situations, especially when conversations are not directly relevant to me, I tend to lose focus more easily.

## How do you stay focused?
Initial Version: For me, the most important thing is to keep a focused environment. If I need to do some work, I try to stay in a stable and quiet place and avoid being disturbed by others.
The second thing is to keep my mood stable, because your emotional state is also very important when you want to concentrate on something.

Revised Version: For me, the most effective strategy is to create a controlled environment. When I need to concentrate, I deliberately choose a quiet and stable setting to minimize external distractions.
In addition, maintaining emotional stability is also essential, as my mood directly affects my ability to focus on complex tasks.

## Is it easy to stay focused in a noisy environment?
Initial Version: For me, not really. If someone talks to me or speaks very loudly—for example, in a café—I can’t focus on a specific task. I tend to listen to what they are saying instead, and I think this is not very good for concentration.

Revised Version: Generally speaking, no. In noisy environments, such as cafés, I find it difficult to concentrate, especially when people are speaking loudly nearby.
In those situations, my attention is easily drawn to surrounding conversations, which negatively affects my productivity.

## Do you enjoy work that requires a high level of concentration?
Initial Version: Yes, I do. I think work that requires a high level of concentration usually also requires high efficiency and careful thinking, which pushes people to improve themselves. I want to be a teacher in the future. Now I’m a master’s student, and I hope to pursue a PhD. If I’m admitted to a PhD program, I would like to teach in the future, because sharing what you have learned and what you want to express is very important to me.

Revised Version: Yes, I do. Tasks that demand a high level of concentration often require efficiency, precision, and sustained mental engagement, which I find intellectually rewarding. This is also closely related to my career aspirations. As a master’s student, I am considering pursuing a PhD, and I hope to work in academia in the future. Teaching and sharing knowledge is meaningful to me, and such work naturally requires a strong ability to concentrate.

# Teachers

## Do you want to be a teacher in the future?
Initial Version: Yes. I think being a teacher is a very meaningful job, because I have been helped a lot by my teachers, and I would like to help others in the same way.

Revised Version: Yes, I do. I believe teaching is a meaningful profession, particularly because I have personally benefited from the guidance and support of my teachers. I would like to contribute in a similar way in the future.

## Do you remember one of your teachers?
Initial Version: Yes, of course. I remember one teacher very clearly because he taught me a lot—not only about my studies, but also about life, pressure, and psychological issues.
I think he was a very good teacher for me.

Revised Version: Yes, very clearly. One teacher had a particularly strong influence on me because he supported me not only academically, but also on a personal level.
He offered guidance on stress management and psychological well-being, which had a lasting impact on my development.

## Do you have a favorite teachers?
Initial Version: Yes, I do. My favorite teacher was the instructor of my bachelor’s thesis.That was the first time I took my studies very seriously, and I became much more engaged in academic work. To some extent, this teacher helped me become a better student. I learned a lot from him, and that was also the first time I became truly interested in academic research.

Revised Version: Yes. My favorite teacher was the supervisor of my bachelor’s thesis. Working with him marked a turning point in my academic experience.It was the first time I approached my studies with serious commitment, and I gradually developed a genuine interest in academic research. His teaching style encouraged critical thinking and academic independence.

## Which were your primary school teacher like?
Initial Version: My primary school teachers were mostly older female teachers. They were gentle, kind, and patient.
I was very naughty at that time, but they were able to discipline me without hurting my feelings. They could solve problems while still protecting children’s emotions.
I think this was the most important quality they had.

Revised Version: My primary school teachers were mostly older female teachers who were gentle, patient, and caring.
Although I was quite mischievous at that age, they were able to guide and discipline me in a way that did not damage my self-esteem. They balanced authority with empathy, which I believe is a crucial quality in education.

# Home/Accomodation
