      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the popularity of following fashion trends has increased significantly, shaping various aspects of daily life. This essay examines the factors contributing to the strong influence of global fashion and contends that, overall, this development produces more negative than positive effects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A primary factor behind the expanding influence of global fashion is the rapid advancement of social media. Technology companies employ algorithms to analyze user preferences and consistently promote fashion-related content on digital platforms. As a result, people are repeatedly exposed to global trends and may feel pressured to follow them. Another reason is peer influence. Fashion often becomes a common topic in social interactions, helping people connect with friends and avoid awkward conversations. Finally, economic factors also play an important role. To increase profits, fashion companies intensively market new trends, encouraging consumers to make more frequent purchases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
