      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can already see that I&amp;rsquo;m going to miss the short half month I spent in New Zealand for the next six months. It all seems to have started back in February when I felt lost in life. I wanted to go into academia, but had almost no substantial work to show for it. So I decided to apply to the IAMCR and if that didn&amp;rsquo;t work out I would look for an internship. Luckily, my application was successful, which gave me a huge boost for what came next. Looking back, even if it hadn&amp;rsquo;t worked out, I would have kept going. I hope to have more time to visit New Zealand again in the future, perhaps next spring, summer or autumn! I&amp;rsquo;d love to share the details of my trip with you, but for now I&amp;rsquo;m keeping the details of hotels, restaurants and activities to myself. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, feel free to drop me a line and I&amp;rsquo;ll share them individually.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
